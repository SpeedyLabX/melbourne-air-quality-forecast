She is super cute and funny but she didn‚Äôt cope well living in the busy animal shelter. I ended up fostering him and I will have to return her to the shelter if she doesn‚Äôt get adopted.\n\nJasmine is healthy, chatty (she talks back), cuddly, and very therapeutic. She is smoochy and loves making air biscuits and plopping into my arms.  She loves interactive playtime and pretending to hunt. \n\nHappy to organise a meet and greet if you‚Äôre interested.\n\nPlease help find a furever loving home for Jasmine!!!\n\nHere are more photos and videos of her: https://www.instagram.com/melbournepawsfoster\n\nPetRescue: https://www.petrescue.com.au/listings/1125406?fbclid=IwY2xjawK_Z-ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFnOGNiTFFrVnUwV2hMNlpXAR4PG8QYDfD-wsg4k_eDj4NxlMvsosiPG-i3O_jbo9xVMlA1PFD_vXBPHAd6Ew_aem_wg_3sNqiBwxiGuyRHIBUVQ \n\nMicrochip number: 956000018443546\nPetRescue ID: 1125406",

        "text": "Starting a new thread because the old one was archived, and wanted to give a heads up of goodness currently in store. Unaffiliated, just a fan passing on the good vibes to counter \\*waves hands around\\*.  \nNewbie?  \nWhat is Cheaper Buy Miles aka CBM?  \nIt's a bunch of inner city melbs stores that sell best by or use by goods at heftily discounted prices.  \nArticle from Kidspot about similar in Sydney, including the kinds of bargains to look out for:  \n[https://www.kidspot.com.au/lifestyle/home/i-found-a-littleknown-supermarket-to-score-ultracheap-groceries/news-story/bf60f99d8db160e8844057ecc47e0446](https://www.kidspot.com.au/lifestyle/home/i-found-a-littleknown-supermarket-to-score-ultracheap-groceries/news-story/bf60f99d8db160e8844057ecc47e0446)  \nBest by = usually can be ignored, because it's goods that don't perish eg: best by dates on dry goods such as rice.  \nUse by = that's one I don't mess with. The sniff test is the winner, so I've been told. Smells weird? Time to chuck.  \nCheck 'em out for locations \\[footscray, flemington, brunswick, fitzroy\\], see their socials for what's in store: [https://www.cheaperbuymiles.com](https://www.cheaperbuymiles.com)  \nWhy we love them: no automatic checkouts, lots of boxes to take your stuff away in, great deals. If you see something you want to try, there's no harm in deciding to buy the thing regardless, and testing it out on the spot. Folks have generously offered me a sample of goodness whilst in queue, only for me to go and track down my own piece of flavor town. If there's something good you want the world to know about, please do this if you can.\n\nRIGHTO:  \nTHE PATH TO DELICIOUSNESS:  \nFrozen Dumpling - there's these new Korean ones - 3 for $10, or $6 for a largish single packet.  \nI used to pfaff around with a combo of oil/stock, trying to get things exactly right, until one day, I was just - what happens if I throw these bad boys into the air fryer?  \nDO IT, PEOPLE! the edges are brown and crispy, with a crispy exterior that you bite through for juicy goodness within that is perfect for dipping. Wide variety of sauces/sides at CBM that rotates on a regular basis - bbq, the fridged miso/sesame, the Kuzu kewpie mayo are all taste sensations.\n\nDaffinois French Cheese:  \nThe issue with CBM is that cheese usually comes in wheels that have you pondering if you need to get that ambulance membership just to be on the safe side. Whilst it's amazing and an extremely good deal to get the large rounds of waxed cheddar etc that come in wheels that weigh a few kilos, the good news is, the daffs come in small sized cute lil red boxes for a cube of cheese that's just the ticket. I think it was around $3. Do not pass go. If you cheese, cheese with these and you will not be disappointed if the creamy crack is your thang.\n\nFrozen apple/berry packs:  \ngrab one of these, and throw them into scones, like so: https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-fluffy-vegan-scones-blueberry-lemon. par bake and freeze for a treat anytime.  \nOr: simple fast breakfast = oats, nut butter (they have almond in stock at the moment, along with the little jars mentioned below if you're quick) + fruit. mix together and bake for a doughy breakfast biscuit type healthy sugarless treat. also a cook ahead and reheat if that's your jam.\n\nPistachio Gelato: - 1 litre? $3.  \nHoly shit. I have eyed these things off, and said no, because reasons. Then I saw something similar in a normal supermarket, and thought fuck it, it's $3, live a little. I get home to the Italian lemon sugar cookies that were slightly burnt on the bottom from a first try at a new recipe/new baking oven (the bench top Kmart Jobbie that air fries/ovens/dehydrates which is gods gift to those electrifying in a unit). Those cookies and this gelato - this is the shit. I remember going to 5 star fanciness restaurant Attica during my salad days where they use the fancy machinery that turns anything into silken goodness. This gelato has the same silkiness, and should be illegal. It's not. If you're having the shittiest of shit days, hell of a turnaround with a movie/pal/whatevs.\n\nPavlova - I have not tried this, but if you're feeding hordes, it's an option and they've been in CBM in their chill cases. You can use the recipe below to top it with roasted apples/other fruits of goodness for something a lil' different...(phwoar - roasted apple with passionfruit would be amazing!).\n\nThere's this punk rock dude turned gourmet chef - Brooks Headley - who now runs a gourmet burger joint in NYC - a sort of 5 star takeaway, and yes, he does the PACOJET (thank you adhd for remembering the weird shit) silky smooth gelato. If you have some cheap ass fruit kicking around, or you go to the local supermarket/market/alleyway/walk in the country, and there's some freaky hard fruit eg: apples, quince, stone fruit, that kinda thang - do this to go with yr gelato: (instead of the honey, you can use the agave nectar from CBM which is like $3, which is a steal) Recipe below from Brooks, but I cheated, left out the basil + turbinado, simply chopped, mixed, shoved, cooked until apples smelt good. Damn. Sally forth and enjoy yr frugal hedonism this weekend....\n\nSLOW-ROASTED FRUIT üçé  \nThis recipe celebrates the beauty of hyper-in-season fruit. It exalts pockmarked skin, stems, seeds, blemishes, black spots, zits, boils, and welts. I prefer yellow nectarines (used in the recipe that follows) in the summer and Honeycrisp apples in fall. In the dead of winter, I don‚Äôt bother. In spring, I hurl myself at the season‚Äôs first apricot. All you need is a pan, an oven, some lemon juice, and some honey. There are a couple other ingredients, but they‚Äôre a bonus. Yield: 4 servings  \nNectarines (do not peel!)¬†  \nHoney¬†¬Ω cup (169 grams)  \nLemon juice¬†¬Ω cup (121 grams)  \nSalt to taste  \nBlack pepper to taste  \nFresh basil¬†3 leaves, torn  \nTurbinado sugar\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250¬∞F. 2. Cut the nectarines in half, discard the pits, and place the fruit in a medium bowl. 3. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Pour half of the mixture over the nectarines and fold together gently to coat. Add the remaining juice mixture and the basil and combine. 4. Arrange the nectarines in a roasting pan, cut side down, and top with the juice. Roast for 20 minutes, flip the nectarines, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and roast an additional 20 minutes. Flip the nectarines a second time and roast until the flesh gives to the touch, 10 to 20 minutes. Let the nectarines sit in their own juices until cool to the touch.\n\nTHINGS WORTH STOCKING UP ON:  \nEMERGENCY RATIONS: if you spot something good, get it for your backpack, your work drawer, your car, your kids bag, whatever... things like small serves of nuts + dried fruit, various snacks, sanitizer, baby wipes, sunscreen, moisturizer, you get the gist. Highly, highly recommend the teriyaki dried peas - massive protein hit and basically a meal that gets you drinking water. Very handy if you go out and need a hand for something  in yr stomach so you don't make stupid decisions. Must pack for backpacking due to being so light + satisfying.\n\nPutting emergency stuff first - in case you get covid, stuck inside for some reason, be prepared.  \nIt's also great to have stuff around to make a fast meal instead of capitalist BS.\n\nCBF MEALS AKA CANNOT BE \\[REDACTED\\]  \nIf you're tired, you've walked into your abode cold, wet and hungry, here's how to be prepared. You will buy yourself a soup thermos with a spoon in the lid. You will buy the following:  \nramen, stock cubes, frozen veg, flavorings, eg peanut butter, and you can be duper prepared, and make/freeze satay sauce with peanut butter garlic etc  \nIf you have a bathtub, run bath, boil water, ramen into thermos with flavorings, frozen veg etc, seal, get into bathtub. By the time you've got the worst of the day off your body, food is ready. Enjoy in bath for minimum cleanup, maximum funs. See also: mangoes etc in summer.\n\nThere's tons of prepackaged meals etc too - choose your poison. Beats takeaway.\n\nPASTA: weird Italian brands I've never heard of with beautiful packaging turn up from time to time. Barilla rocks in regularly. If pasta is for you, these are for you.\n\nJAM: once upon a time, I swore to myself that I would get every flavor of Bonne Mamman jam - it's fancy French stuff that is rather delicious. If you haunt CBM frequently enough, you'll get the different flavors, and to me there's no such thing as bad: apricot, blackberry, strawberry and rhubarb....swoons...\n\nTOOTHPASTE + TOILETRIES - so cheap, and great for adhd people so you can get a different dopamine hit of flavor excitement each day - cool mint ! super clean! kids blueberry! etc etc\n\nRICE:- those huge bags are good bags.\n\nSALT/SPICES/OILS/ETC - frugal flavourtown.\n\nDRIED LEGUMES:  1.75kg of kidney beans? dried, it's going to take a while to go off, and that's burgers, curries,  Mexican goodness, you name it for freaking ever.\n\nFROZEN FRUIT + VEG: ü•ëüçéüçèüßÖü´õüåΩü•îü•¶  \nEvery house needs a bag of frozen goodness like peas. yes, for eating (throw them in a salad, defrosted by lunchtime), but also for emotional regulation. If someone is snot crying - you know, the big overwhelming all the feels - whack a bag of frozen peas over their eyes with a tea towel/something so they don't get freezer burn. Get them to hold them breath, and count for as long as possible. Chills them the fuck out real fast. Ask me how I know ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMy love for corn knows no bounds and it pops in from time to time both as kernels + ribs. The ribs (think a full cob, cut horizontally) is great for soup making - just throw the whole thing into a rice cooker until heated through, cut off the kernels, ribs back in the water + boiled as a soup base - great for ramen. The onion rings + potato cakes/scollops also rate.\n\nPIZZA: there's the deliciousness of Dr euro whatever his name is cheese pizza. Of course you already have a stash of olives/mushroom pate/sauerkraut/frozen salami/mushrooms/deliciousness to doctor that thing with if you so desire.\n\ndrinks - I went a tad crazy when I first started going, only for my dentist to ask me what I'd been drinking. Coffee! Nope he says...have you been drinking \\*anything\\* with bubbles? You'd think mineral water would be safe, right? It's acidic and fucks with yr teeth enamel. Likewise, aluminum cans (aside from fucking up the planet - excellent story of a couple of USA journos hot footing it to WA to see how planet wrecking their local company \\*really\\* is - https://www.publicsource.org/alcoa-mines-threaten-australia-forest-series/), they have BPA which wrecks you. That said, you're in a store that is a hotbed of manufactured food, we all die, etc etc.  \nThe kombucha and grapefruit soda particularly rate in summer. If they still have those little jars of nut paste to make milk, rather genius for winter hot chocolates. (usually situated close to the chocolate near the checkout).\n\nkids stuff: I don't have a child, but they do have fancy organic cereals and other things that would be totally worth stocking up on, along with kids toiletries/health things.\n\nHit me with your recs of good stuff and what to do with it below....",

They gave their spiel and I checked with them on material quality, who will be doing the installation (they said it would be them), and checked that getting the rebate would be no problem. \n\nI didn't have bills handy so they asked to come back the next day when I could have them. In the meantime I checked out how the rebate works and read their documents. They're not listed as an approved installer so they categorically can't access the rebate program.\n\nI let the salesperson come back and specifically asked them three times if they would be able to access the rebate and it went from \"yes\", to \"don't worry it's included in the invoice\", to \"it takes months to process - pay us an worry about it later\". I asked him to quote me and specifically include on the quote how the rebate will work. Never heard back from them again. I'm sure I might have got solar panels from this company, but overpaid and maybe had dodgy installers.\n\nSince then I've talked with an approved installer and the difference is night and day. There's no suss language about how their billing works, and they were able to describe exactly how the rebate process works. \n\nFYI in case they knock on your door ",

        "text": "Has anyone else seen the show? \n\nAfter I left last night I was googling reviews to validate my experience but they were mostly positive! \n\nMy experience was not that positive haha \n\nThe acting was clunky, a lot of the performance reminded me of high school theatre - though Frodo was charming and a lot of the actors had good moments it just wasn‚Äôt consistent. \n\nSpeaking of inconsistent the hobbits did not \nenunciate very well. Pip and Merry seemed very energetic and I wanted to like them, but I could only understand every other sentence. \n\nThe hobbits and ensemble would carry their instruments on stage and play them throughout the show‚Äî this bit I LOVED. The music in the hobbit scenes was great, very folky and very lively.\n\nThe elves were‚Ä¶. The worst part of the show. They had the worst costumes. So did Aragon for that matter. I‚Äôve seen better costumes at the Renn Faire. They looked like they were bought off Temu, the material looked cheap and poorly made. The music choice felt soulless and repetitive and forgettable for the elves. Galadriels song felt like a reprisal of Arwens song even though they were different songs (side note Arwen was a fantastic singer). \n\nThe special effects felt cheap. It felt like something made for a high school production with a cheap budget. When Gandalf is telling Frodo the story of Gollum, there‚Äôs a video played in the background of stick figures. IF they were trying something artistic, like using shadow puppets, they did it too basically and it looks amateur. \n\nThe worst part of the whole show? The script. \n\nThey tried to cram in EVERYTHING. You can‚Äôt cram in 11hours of content in a 3hr show. I was expecting lots of cut to the story. But the worst part of it was the exposition. Most of the scenes were characters sitting around explaining all of the history. Literally we didn‚Äôt need to know most of it. Boromirs death was ruined because they were trying to squeeze in more exposition for Aragon. And because they were squeezing in some much unnecessary content there was never any breathing room in the show. And it was hard to feel any emotion for anything at all that happened. Even the actors emotions felt particularly faked because of the rush of cram so much needless information into this show. \n\nAnyway I‚Äôm disappointed. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything high budget but I was hoping for at least charming. This was a mess and I frustrated they charged so much for a ticket for a low quality show. And the reviews!! The reviews tell you to go see it! Did anyone else see it and feel the same way? \n\n",

Even Falls Creek, Buller and Hotham at the tops of the High Country recorded warmer minimums than Coldstream with -3.8¬∫, -3.7¬∫ and -4.5¬∫ respectively despite being over 1700m higher in elevation.\n\nWith a¬†[trend towards an increasing density of high pressure systems](http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/climate/change/trendmaps.cgi?map=high_density&area=aus&season=0112&period=1970)¬†sitting over our part of the country under the effects of a changing climate, occasional days of low/freezing minimum temperatures like this are likely to increase as the calm and clear skies under high pressure allows the heat to radiate away from the surface overnight.",

So, I monitor the air quality from the EPA around Melbourne using my home automation system, I monitor 3 sensors around my area to get an average.  \n\nSo, this morning I was at Mentone Beach, and noticed it was quite polluted, and I could hardly see Frankston, let alone Arthurs Seat, so I thought I would check my monitors when I get home.\n\nSo I checked, and they hadn't updated since 3:30PM on Friday, usually they update every couple of hours.  I went to the EPA website, thinking it maybe my monitoring wasn't working, and it also showed that most of the sensors around Melbourne were N/A\n\nI have noticed this in the past, when it's been a windless day, the sensors are offline\n\nSo, my crackpot theory is that when they anticipate that it will be little wind, or likely to have pollution, they take them offline for Maintenance, maybe the EPA has some KPI to keep the pollution levels below a certain number...\n\n\n\n",

I'm expecting roughly 80-120 people to attend. \n\nCurrently the venue/function area I've booked will be open until at least 1am (but can close later at 2.30am pending venue discretion and people still paying for drinks, which knowing my various friendship groups I'm almost positive they will be).\n\nAlso knowing my friends (myself included), we will want to continue the shenanigans after the venue closes and I'm trying to brainstorm where to go and what to do after from say 2am-2.30am onwards.  \nThe issue is I don't know the exact number who will want to kick on after. It could be 10 people it could be 30-40 people.\n\nI've thought of renting a large Air BnB property somewhere near-ish by but worried about potential noise complaints. I know people won't mind travelling 10-20 min via taxi/uber after but the only venue I can possibly think of that will be open late enough is Revolver (insert sad face here).\n\nThe other issue I face is it'll be a combo of early 20 something year old's to my age bracket of 40 year olds so finding a venue everyone enjoys is a small issue. However I'm confident enough most won't care too much about this (a least those closest to me) and just more focused on finding somewhere open afterwards.\n\n  \nDoes  anyone have any thoughts, suggestions or ideas on where to go, what to do or where to kick on at this hour after my main party celebrations ends?",

        "text": "I went to Revs the other day for the first time. Obviously everyone knows the stories of people dying behind the couches or getting stabbed or whatever but places with a bunch of druggies having a dance are usually pretty chill so that wasn't my worry. What ended up causing problems instead was the whole room being turned into a sauna. The heat and humidity were so high that vision was limited by sweaty steam and the ceiling and air vents were literally dripping with condensation. I get that the windows need to be closed because of noise pollution, but the aircons along one of the walls weren't even turned on. The walls and ceiling were growing mould. Male employees were running around shirtless. Women dancing in skirts were splashing me with the water than had condensed at their hems. The floor was slick from both spilled drinks and the humidity.\n\nThis could have been manageable if a bit disgusting if it weren't for the glass all over the floor. I don't think I've seen glass be served at a venue like this before, where it's so hard to move around and there's no space to put drinks down. The floor was covered in shards, and with the floor being so slippery, it turned dancing into an exercise in minefield navigation. To avoid the floor, some people opted to dance on the couches, which covered them in filth. This meant the only place with anywhere to sit down or see further than 3 metres ahead of you was the toilets, where instead of ripe armpit you had to contend with the stench of stale piss. To even get to the toilets was a challenge because you needed to attempt to squeeze past multiple moist, writhing human bottlenecks.\n\nI know the place has a semi ironic reputation but even if you're on drugs, why would you be fanging to come back? And if you're a big name performer (like the one I went to see), why would you choose to perform there if you have to wipe down your equipment with rags that become wet just by being in contact with the air, or have audience members fan you because it's so hot? Has it always been like this?\n\nAnyway, by the time I left, I don't think I have ever wanted a slushy so badly in my life. And to be honest I kind of want to go again.",

A little bit about us: we're not party people but we enjoy a beer at a bar, we like nature (in St Kilda we would be close to the St Kilda Beach and in Fairfield to the top of the Yarra Bend Park), we love riding our bikes and walking around, we like going to gigs, to cafes...\n\nWe're afraid St Kilda might be gentrified (saw lots of AirBnBs) and overpriced, and Fairfield might be too residential and dull. Are our fears founded?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your answers, they were very helpful.

        "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nMy partner and I are looking for a 1 bed 1 bathroom apartment in Melbourne, with a budget of $400 to $500/week. \n\nWe saw this ad on Facebook of a guy renting a super cool apartment for just $350 in South Melbourne. We chated on Messenger, he told us he had a lot of candidates (okay, so far everything's normal, it's very cheap) and \"a couple of people wanting to secure it with a bond already\" (hmmm not so normal).\n\nWhen asked to do an inspection, he said he had people living there until the 15th so he sent me a video of the apartment instead. He also told me he wants to meet the candicates in person, so we're meeting him tomorrow at a caf√© for a \"quick chat\".\n\nI'm suspicious because:\n-too cheap\n-when searching the pics of the flat on google lense, there's an ad on AirBnB of the same place on the same location, but the owner is somebody else (but it's true that no dates are available so maybe it's a former AirBnB and now they're looking for somebody long term...?)\n-no inspection (even if the flat is real, I want to see it before saying yes to it?)\n-the ad is now paused on facebook (maybe because he has too many applicants?)\n\nHmmm. I don't know what to think. I've dealt with scammers before but the always ask for money upfront by email, not in person, so maybe this is legit? I'm not Australian so I don't know if a situation like this is normal here. Would you go to the meeting tomorrow if you were us?\n\nThank you so much for your time!\n\nEDIT: Thanks everybody for your input! You're very right. I reported his profile on Facebook. I don't want to waste my time and energy meeting with him.\n\nI asked because in the previous city I lived in here in Australia, when contacting my previous landlady (on Flatmates) she was like \"nah, I don't do inspections or write leases, can't be bothered. If you want the flat be here tomorrow morning and I'll give you the keys while you pay the bond\". I was surprised because she didn't know me or asked me for references or proof of funds... But we both took a leap of faith and it turned out great haha. I had similar experiences when buying things second-hand on Facebook (my car, for example). I find Australians so impossibly nice, well-meaning and honest compared to my country, it's difficult to see scams haha. Thanks again üòä",

He‚Äôs being treated through the public system however we have private cover and the resources available to speed this up at any cost and his surgical team has advised that they need to remove 15mm of jawbone as part of the resection ‚Äî likely a segmental mandibulectomy.\n\nFrom everything I‚Äôve read, this aligns with best practice for locally advanced OSCC with bone invasion, with the goal of achieving R0 resection (clear margins of ‚â•5 mm histologically, or 1‚Äì1.5 cm clinically). They‚Äôve also explained that it will take **5 weeks to prepare the surgical cast or guide** used to plan and perform the resection accurately.\n\nI completely understand that custom prosthetics, surgical planning, and multi-disciplinary prep take time ‚Äî but I‚Äôm anxious about the risk of disease progression during that five-week window. I‚Äôve read that timely surgical intervention is key for bone-invading OSCC, and that delays can impact outcomes.\n\n# Has anyone here either:\n\n* Successfully **moved to a private hospital or maxillofacial unit** to reduce wait times?\n* Found a **public hospital with a shorter lead time** for jaw resection?\n* Used **private health cover to fast-track the surgical casting or guide creation process**?\n\nI‚Äôve looked into the Royal Melbourne Hospital who are the leaders in this according to their website and the specialist, and a close second being **St Vincent‚Äôs**, and other oral/maxillofacial units ‚Äî many appear to offer comprehensive services, but I‚Äôm unsure how fast they can move or how the public/private split affects these timelines.\n\nFor context, I have a strong grasp of the technical aspects (surgical margin planning, reconstruction options, AI/3D virtual surgery tools, etc.), but right now I just want to **get my dad treated faster if possible**, without compromising the quality of care.\n\nI‚Äôm open to any advice, second opinion recommendations, hospital suggestions (Melbourne/Victoria region preferred), or insights on navigating the **public-private crossover**. Even just hearing from someone who‚Äôs been through something similar would help.\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî I‚Äôm doing everything I can to advocate for him üôè",

        "text": "Look, before I begin, I must acknowledge that everyone's experience at this organisation in any capacity (whether student, visitor or an academic) would be different. Nonetheless, this shouldn't preclude me from sharing mine. \n\nI have updated the post to remove all external links due to mods requests. But there is verifyable data backing to everything I share with you below. This post does not break any rules of this community, unless it's for censorship purposes. \n\nHere is my story across many years of being involved at Unimelb, one of the thousands of other people in a similar boat:\n\nEventhough it's got the \"name\" and an absolutely fantastic campus, thats pretty much the top 2 things on the offer unfortunately.\n\nSandwiched between very resentful staff, whom the talented, passionate and knowledgeable members of already been moved on due to hyper-casualisated workforce combined with budget cuts. And, super greedy money printing industrial corporational complex overseen by an executive team with questionable integrity. (as a point of reference, vice-chancellor makes three times as much as the Prime Minister at $1.5m+)\n\nSo we get this residual staff, whom are constantly changing with poor comprehension of the educational content. Teaching topics that were prepared by a career professor stuck in 30 years ago, whom has no idea about the real world applications of the damn thing they have prepared. \n\nFor the privilege of spending a fortune to receive this \"education\", you constantly get above-inflations ever-increasing invoices which you are stuck paying with since otherwise you wouldnt get your \"degree\". \n\nAs a not-for-profit, Unimelb technically can't distribute any \"profit\", but guess what? Nothing stops them from paying themselves fat pay checks, as well as playing a massive fucking real world Monopoly by constantly building very expensive new buildings. Whilst systematically underpaying their staff.\n\nThe funny/sad thing is that the more they jazz up the campus, the more people want to move there to be students for the world class \"education\" marketed. Despite of financing this by shitifying the educational quality and experience. \n\nSo, we have a class room whom majority are international students, some of which are cool, driven and smart. Whilst some of which can barely speak English, got no interest or drive whatsoever whom is only there to get the piece of paper \"degree\" which you know need to work with in a group for assignments. \n\nThis is before we get to the extensive unethical research links between numerous departments of the university with multinational defence companies, literally developing weapons of destruction and war. \n\nSo, as a result we get an institution that's piggy banking on it's name and reputation as the \"first ranked\" university of Australia for the past decade. I'm soo disappointed, dissatisfied and even ashamed to be involved in such a shit show that I would have ask for a refund from the government, if I knew that was a possibility to do so. \n\nDo yourself a favour, go to another uni, any other uni but the Unimelb. \n\nThanks for reading, and love to hear what my other redditors think.",

He did also mention someone ring 000 around that time to report that a large black car also hit into a parked car around that time..\n\nAnyway, am just looking to see if anyone has any recommendations at this point? I‚Äôve taken photos of where the incident happened and there‚Äôs plenty of businesses around there I would have suspected would have cameras. Am I allowed to ask for this CCTV or does it have to come from police? I‚Äôve only recently immigrated to Australia so I am not completely sure of all the legalities of these things. I know back home the police were equally as useful in this situation.\n\nI‚Äôve added some photos of where the crash happened. Thanks all",

One  of the few places I can independently browse shops is Melbourne Central, but don‚Äôt really have much time to explore a whole lot, so I want to plot things out in advance.  I‚Äôm trying to find some places where I can get random things for the cheapest prices. My list is as follows:\n\n\\-Replacement plain neck chains. Small or big ones. Silver preferably, for everyday wear.\n\n\\-Black Nail Polish.\n\n\\-Hand Sanitiser. The little tiny nifty bottles  that you can attach  to bags.  Can‚Äôt find them in the chemist for some  reason, unless  I somehow missed  them.\n\n\\-Any alt/ Gothic Apparel Stores. I only know about Dangerfield, but the don‚Äôt have much of a selection, so I‚Äôd like to find more  if possible.\n\n\\-Any good piercers I can check out. Me and my friend want  to find a place to go together.\n\nEDIT: Little Review: For the hand sanitisers, I went to Bath and Body works. Pretty cute, compact, and not too pricey. Absolutely PERFECT to put on my bag. They have a variety of cool scents too. However,  I should probably mention that I'm pretty sure they ALL contain microplastics, which are harmful to the environment, so be mindful of that.  \nPandora has good chains, surprisingly. Didn‚Äôt know they were known for quality.  \nThere‚Äôs a few brands of black nail polish at Chemist Warehouse. Big set up there.  \nI went to Hairhouse for the piercing and it was soooo good. Barely felt ANYTHING!! The needles they use these days are great. Good selection of Sleepers too, but I only wanted a simple flat Titanium silver stud for my Helix for now. There's also the Socks Club that I found and they sell some cool little Alt accessories. this was on the G and LG level, pretty maneuverable for me. Thanks so much everyone!!",

        "text": "Hi there! Soooooo regarding this post im actually in a pretty big dilemna right now as my current housing is considered really bad. A little backstory, im currently a student that left military life and finishing off my studies before re-entering the workforce and my current accomodation is rather bad. Its my first time renting and the person I rented from is a established agency for housing, I did not check my room before renting for 9 months and barely 1 week into my lease its already rather bad. Here is a list of issues I noticed.\n\n1) bad ventilation (my room specifically even with the window wide open still has rather bad ventilation, the air is nearly still with little to no wind. Not only that but I think my ventilation duct is connected to the kitchen so whenever people cook my room is filled with smell)\n\n2) Hygene issue (This place is rather small and cramped with the toilet shower being less then 1 square metre. But my main issue is how many bugs this place has and the worst is that I saw a rather big rat in the kitchen once with me killing a large insect twice a day)\n\n3) security and privacy (The building on the listing looked to be a rather well made apartment, but when I arrived I noticed it was a half converted office building. Half because the old logo is still on the building and all the rooms are seperated by 2 layers of plywood walls. They are also still using the centralized heating system. This is rather concerning since the place looks easily broken into and the washing machine is outside the building.)\n\n4) Building permit (I'm not too sure how this works but surely the place is not up to standard, sound travels through the building even if you talk softly and the stairways are very cramped.)\n\nIm currently seeking to move out and find another accomodation but the agency wants me to pay half my bond as a fee and rental until they find a replacement. This is stated very loosely in my contract and if I recall by law, i'm only supposed to pay 25% of the total year rent if it is a fixed lease term which this is.\n\nI'm currently looking for solutions to minimize loss as majority of my money comes from my savings and thus do not wish to be at too much of a loss. Might I request help from the community if possible? Much thanks!",

This is our first time renting and living in Melbourne.\n\nWe rented the apartment directly from the owner‚Äîthere was no real estate agent involved, and we didn‚Äôt have to fill out any official paperwork. This was the first property we inspected, and we liked it, so we took it.\n\nNow, the owner is asking us to clean the walls and part of the ceiling above the stove due to some black marks (apparently from high-heat cooking and smoke). She insists that it's our responsibility to clean it or pay for cleaning, saying it‚Äôs not her job to do so. However, from what I‚Äôve read about rental rules, it doesn‚Äôt seem like this is our responsibility‚Äîespecially since the marks were already there when we moved in (though she blames us for them and we don't have the proof to prove our point).\n\nAdditionally, some friends have pointed out that our rental arrangement might not be entirely legal. We‚Äôve been living here for over a year, and we‚Äôre unsure what to do at this point. Are we in any legal trouble?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "Hey folks, I've searched Reddit for tips on cheap photo printing in the past, and since I've just done a bit of a comparative test, thought I'd better share the results and give back to the community!\nFirst, just want to note that results may come down to the maintenance and quality of individual store machines, so even though I may have a good experience with one chain store location, you may still need to do your own tests at your own location.\nFor my tests I used photos from a Sony mirrorless camera (good quality photos). I did 7x 6x4 prints with various different colours and detail types, and 1x 8x12 print.\nHere are my results!\n\nKmart Altona North: Best for detail level, but the colours are very over-saturated. If you want super poppy colours this is the one for you. However the pics sometimes look quite unnatural. The 8x12 print in particular was a bit gross, and had a bit of a green tint.\n\nTed's: ordered online, had delivered so location unknown. Colour reproduction not too bad, although lacking some detail, particularly in skin tone variations so not great for photos of people. 8x12 photo has a slight green tint.\n\nHarvey Norman Hoppers Crossing: they printed in store. They also lost some of my photos and couldn't reprint so I had to resubmit and pay again! Big markdown for service. The prints were very dull and looked somewhat underexposed. Colours dull.\n\nBig W Altona Meadows: they printed the photos off site and had them sent in store. The colours were the most accurate reproduction of the colours from my original photos, across both the 6x4 prints and the 8x12. Details not as sharp as Kmart but not as dull as Ted's or Harvey Norman. One downside - the trimming was imperfect so some of my photos have a white edge which I am going to have to cut off.\n\nOfficeworks: I didn't bother to test as the online reviews were terrible.\n\nMy pick: Big W. Husband checked all the options and agrees. The trimming is a little annoying but I have a small guillotine so I am okay to live with it in exchange for cheap prints with accurate colours.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to other printing photos in Melbourne!

On Wednesday Ball tried delivering bread but, for her customers, that‚Äôs not the point of the Bread Box Baker.\n\n\n‚ÄúMyself and my three girls, we‚Äôd [walk there and] take the dog,‚Äù says Mick Duyvestyn, 50, who also lives in Mount Martha. ‚ÄúIt was a good time to chat, to hang out, be away from technology.‚Äù\n\n\nRegular Mardi Mason, 41, says: ‚ÄúThere are less opportunities for people these days to interact with their community. This was one of them.‚Äù\n\n\nThe council confirmed to this masthead that it was acting on a complaint about increased traffic due to Ball‚Äôs bread box, but did not share the number of complaints received.\n\n\nBall says she usually makes 70 loaves, which are all sold within 60 to 90 minutes to customers arriving either on foot or by car.\n\n\n‚ÄúThe most I‚Äôve ever seen there is five cars ‚Ä¶ and three or four people waiting,‚Äù says Duyvestyn. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a quick transaction. You‚Äôre in and out, and lots of people walk.‚Äù\n\n\nMason is extremely frustrated by the decision. ‚ÄúOne person‚Äôs complained so the council‚Äôs acted, but they haven‚Äôt actually stopped to think how that ‚Ä¶ has a flow-on effect to something that‚Äôs really lovely within the community.‚Äù\n\n\nMeanwhile, Geelong cafe The Local has been in a 2‚Öü‚ÇÇ-year battle with the council to keep its outdoor dining parklet, which came to a head on January 23 when council officers tried to remove the parklet after hours. Owner Ben McLachlan estimates he‚Äôs spent at least $14,000 on lawyers, engineers and designers to resolve the dispute.\n\n\nThe parklet, installed in December 2020, is the only seating at the cafe, which operates on a takeaway model. More than 2600 people have signed a petition to keep the parklet.\n\n\nIn mid-2022, the City of Greater Geelong advised it would not be renewing The Local‚Äôs parklet permit due to traffic safety concerns, and asked for it to be redesigned.\n\n\nMcLachlan says he‚Äôs offered alternative designs, including installing a concrete barrier, but believes the council keeps changing its requirements, commissioning three road safety audits between 2022 and 2024. During that time, the council has had three chief executives.\n\n\nParklets ‚Äì dining structures built in spaces previously used for car parking ‚Äì rose to prominence in Victoria during the pandemic. Many councils later allowed venues to keep their parklets permanently for an annual fee, recognising their popularity and role in activating streets.\n\n\nThe City of Greater Geelong was due to release a draft outdoor dining strategy in April 2023 but currently does not have a parklet program in place.\n\n\n‚ÄúThe way people dine has changed,‚Äù says McLachlan. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs been the cause of concern for our community [over this dispute]. People like to walk their dogs and have a coffee in the fresh air now, or bring their prams, or meet people.‚Äù\n\n\nMcLachlan recently learned his business needs to commission a fourth road safety audit to get its parklet permit, despite the council already paying for three reports.\n\n\nThe two cases highlight the tension between community and compliance, particularly in regional suburbs where residents are often seeking greater connection with their neighbours.\n\n\nIn Mount Martha, Ball discovered none of the permits available in her shire suited her business, which is neither a farmgate nor a takeaway shop nor a retail premises. The only option would be a $13,000 roaming food truck permit, of which there are only four available on the whole of the peninsula.\n\n\n‚ÄúI just wish the council would use common sense,‚Äù says regular customer Mason. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be black and white.‚Äù\n\n\nMornington Peninsula Shire describes its region as ‚Äúone of the richest food bowls in the state‚Äù and runs a Mornington Peninsula Produce labelling initiative that encourages people to support a ‚Äúthriving local food system‚Äù.\n\n\n‚ÄúWe are a region known for makers and growers and creatives, and yet [council] is only interested when it‚Äôs money-raising and viable for them,‚Äù says Ball.\n\n\nIn response to questions, Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Anthony Marsh said: ‚ÄúWhile changes like these can sometimes be challenging, it‚Äôs great to see the community come together in support. I‚Äôm thrilled that another local business in Mount Martha Village has embraced the baker, allowing them to keep sharing their delicious creations with the community.‚Äù\n\n\nWhile Ball is grateful to have used the doorway of the local wine bar temporarily, she is looking for a more suitable location that will fit her blue kiosk.\n\n\nMcLachlan dismantled The Local‚Äôs parklet on March 2, fearing another removal attempt by the council, and is awaiting the results of the fourth road safety audit.\n\n\nThe City of Greater Geelong did not respond to questions about the amount it has spent on road safety audits and its specific concerns relating to The Local‚Äôs parklet.\n\n\nInstead it issued this statement on behalf of the executive director of city infrastructure, James Stirton: ‚ÄúAt the City of Greater Geelong, community safety is our primary consideration, and we‚Äôve been extremely clear and consistent about this.\n\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always encouraging small businesses to be innovative in how they serve their customers, but this must be done without compromising safety.\n\n\n‚ÄúWe have demonstrated that we are willing to work with the owner regarding their new permit application, and we look forward to an outcome that is both safe and beneficial for all road users, cafe patrons, the owner and the broader community.‚Äù\n",

        "text": "So I've been living in a 20+ floor apartment building for approx. seven years. Initially it was a great place to live in terms of the building itself and the OC fees were reasonably high at the time but it was worth it.\n\nI feel now though that the hot water service is constantly going down for maintenance/urgent repairs, similarly with the air conditioning...the standard of cleanliness seems to be going south as well yet our fees have just gone up again so we are paying best part of $7-8k p/year and what we get in return is just regressing.\n\nWe have a sauna & a small gym (each one probably about 3-4 people capacity) and a shared garden area that has a couple barbeques and some plants. There's staff on reception during business hours and security overnight. So with all these features of the place¬†**I'm not expecting to pay peanuts by any means**¬†but the fees just seem to be going up and up whilst the return on expenditure is just going down (especially air conditioning and hot water).\n\nSo having said that, is this a typical experience for other apartment owners in similar buildings? Is anyone particularly happy with how their OC treats them and does anyone have any advice on how to get involved in the OC meetings? I've been meaning to attend but life and mental health have been getting in the way, plus I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing lol.\n\nI'm particularly keen to hear how often you are left without hot water/air conditioning in similar buildings and whether this is a typical experience, and whether my gripes are justified or if I'm just being a bit of a karen.\n\nAny input appreciated.",

        "text": "Really, really frustrating. My partner, best friend of a decade and I have been absolutely paying out of our arse for a 1 bed shoebox for $580 per week, and our wonderful landlord wants us out a day earlier - that day is tomorrow and so far we have nowhere to go lol.\n\nWe've applied for a ridiculous amount of places, called REAs, been ghosted by estate agents constantly saying they'll call back, posted in as many groups on Facebook as possible, gotten nowhere but sinde mocking, we have my girlfriends father as guarantor, offered extra rent, tried every trick in the book, 20k savings for myself, we keep getting rejections or texts even hours after applying saying places have been mysteriously immediately leased. Someone I know has faced constant rejections for months and is actively losing their mental state over it and i don't blame them remotely. My girlfriend has been so fucked over by this that she hasn't left the bed or eaten in days, and my friend and I are trying to carry shit as much as we can.\n\nI just want a fucking roof over my head, man.\n\nI feared most inspections I'd go to would have seas of people like i hear about on Reddit (and the open one for our apartment!! 30 people crammed into one place :/), but every place we've been to has like four to five people max, talked to the agents, immediately applied when links sent, we still get nowhere. It really shouldn't be this hard finding a 2 bed place under $500 per week, my last rental before this was $450 for an okay 3 bedroom house, we got it on ridiculously short notice, and I moved in last year mid eviction season when everyone was applying for places midst a bunch of friends for evicted from their places, but things fell apart with my old housemates health severely declining from their brain tumor, being massively immunocompromised and they ended up moving interstate in the winter - which is why I'm with my partner and have been since July.\n\nWith regards to how fucked we are, I've already had a stint homeless for a month a couple years ago after fleeing an apartment full of cat shit and mould, being subletted by someone who was serially abusive which destroyed my mental state, and I really do not want to be homeless again, let alone have my partner and friend fucked too, and we all want to stay together. My gf and friend can at least access services and such, I feel absolutely fucked as someone over here on a visa, when things settle down I do intend on getting a partner visa, but fuck me this is ridiculous, I wish I knew what to do, like I'm actually at a loss\n\nIs it just because we're in our early/mid 20s? Is it because we're all trans? Do they just assume it'll be a party house or some shit? We're not like that, the only parties we'll have are lan parties playing shit games on our laptops with a few friends at best. We just want a house :// \n\nWe have to figure out moving shit, most movers can't come to our apartment block because of the lack of space and the loading bay is near impossible to access. Going absolutely insane, thankfully we don't have overly much in the name of things, the main worry is our mattress lol. Going to go to Kmart and buy a shit carpet steamer about it and deep clean the place after last week's inspection and try not to break down until I'm literally in better place. I should be at the pub with my friends, seeing people I care about from interstate, my girlfriend should be practising for a show for a friend's band, instead shes on the verge of icing herself. We shouldn't be stressing about not having a place come tomorrow evening and worrying for the two I care the most about, but I guess that's just the way shit is. really fucking demoralising.\n\nIt shouldn't be fucking be like this, I hear about people back in the UK moving into rentals on the same day, going off experience I know it's far more expensive as a whole but I lived in the worst part of the UK to live affordably. We can maintain a tidy place, we can function, we can afford this shit, it's ridiculous. My girlfriend got our current place easily enough, but that was when she had a substantial amount of money before an ex financially abused her out of all of it, I don't want this shit to end badly, I'm ridiculously worried for everyone's mental state, and I really do just want vague security and comfort after two and a half years of explicitly not having much in the name of any since moving here.\n\nNeeded to air this out. wish I had it in me to even feel something over this. I just want to fucking move man, I just want things to be okay for the cunts I care about.",

They transferred their service just a few days after I lodge the bond on RTBA, and a couple of days ago, my request was dennied by RTBA.\n\nThe new REA finally showed me the exit condition report, which was a month and a half after I left the property and there was some damage including some stains on a white table, two broken chairs and a missing bin. The chairs were low quality ones so it cracked when I leanned on it but I did not contact the previous REA about it so that was completely on my end. However, I was 100% sure that the bin was still in the property the day I left Melbourne and after that only the people from the cleaning service accessed the property. This cleaning service which was recommended by my previous REA also charged me almost 600aud for a 1 bed 1 bath but did not clean the stains on the table. Overall, I was orderred to pay 765aud for surface restoration, and for replacing a 20 liter bin and 2 low quality chairs. I asked for the quotes 3 days ago but they haven't replied.\n\nThe new REA issued this with VCAT and I got my hearing order just this week. However, the problem is that my Visa is going to end in March as well as my bank account. I cannot afford 765aud and I surely don't want to waste my time doing this anymore.

And are they cheap?\n\n2) **Must-go coffee shops?** I'm a bit of a coffee snob, and love coffee shops that have SUPER high quality coffee (Ethiopian / Yemeni).\n\n3) **Street-skating spots?** This is a long shot, but if anyone on this reddit is (or knows a) local skateboarder, we'd love to hear about some spots to hit, and how much trouble we can get in (we don't know the laws down unda').\n\n4) **What else?** We've got a whole week in MEL, and want to do awesome stuff for cheap, but have no idea where to start. Surfing? Bar hopping? Skydiving? Hell yeah, we're in for everything!!\n\n\n\nThank you guys so much! We're just looking for cool stuff / people in your hometown, so any advice is appreciated!! ",

        "text": "My dad always used to talk how much better pizza places were back in the 80s. Not sure how true that is, but from what I've seen myself there has been a massive degrade in the quality of pizzerias over the years, especially past covid where some of the businesses in my area were sold to new management.\n\nMy issues with current pizzas: Made with very thick base, loaded with low quality ingredients and barely any cheese, barely any sauce. (and I'm talking actual tomato sauce not bloody bbq) I used to scarf down pizza from local areas, now I'm kind of disgusted by them, they all have the same blandness. Yet these places tend to get near 5 stars somehow, people love quantity over quality I guess. Honestly I find dominos far better now.\n\nAre there any places I may be unaware of or should consider revisiting? I know there's decent enough restaurants but they're too expensive, I am looking for a good regular place. Pizzas didn't need to be woodfired to be decent. ",

Armed assailants entered a home, apparently with a gun, threatened the resident, beat them, and left them in a very bad way.\n\nFollowing this, the alleged assailants were seen in the area knocking on doors, threatening people, stealing property from front yards etc, people were understandably scared as police were seemingly very slow to respond.\n\nWhat came from this is that is was discovered the people were in the new apartments recently opened, and somehow it was deduced (with no proof I have seen) that they were in low cost housing (which is a government requirement with large scale developments now of course).\n\nAfter a few days to a week, the people were arrested, not before their movements being tracked and posted on WhatsApp, along with real time posting of the arrest itself.\n\nWhat has now happened in the following weeks is constant discussion of everyone walking around that looks like they don't belong.\n\nThe brother of a Merri-Bek councillor is part of the group and talked about wanting to make sure \"problem people\" weren't allowed into the housing. He refused to elaborate on what \"problem people\" were, or how this would be policed.\n\n(EDIT - context for the above comment follows)\n\nThe councillor has also been a part of the conversation and did not speak out against this attitude either, thus tacitly agreeing with not wanting to \"problem people\" in the housing.\n\nIf I were a councillor and someone related to me was being this unwelcoming and prejudiced, I would have spoken up if I disagreed with them.\n\nPeople are now posting about every coming and going, including posting up things like seeing someone walking while smoking at night\n\nDiscussions of people \"looking dodgy\" and the few that have spoken up against making assumptions or being unfair have been called woke, easily offended etc.\n\nSo this is now the attitude that is being shown in the group against people who speak up against the bigotry and assumptions being made about people living in low cost housing, and this is being accepted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocmccbjhzwge1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=306c7e100ea7a11f80745b1280a7ddd6481db228\n\nWhat makes this especially crazy is that crime has always happened around here (as it does everywhere), but the knowledge of it with an honestly heinous act against someone has stirred up a load of fear and obviously people suddenly feel unsafe.\n\nWe have a large complex of community housing just north east of the Pentridge area on Murray Road, along with community housing dotted throughout that area, so low income people have already been in close proximity.\n\nCars have been stolen before in the area, hoons have driven through the streets in the early hours of the morning for the entire 7ish years I have lived here. None of this okay, but it's also part of living in Melbourne and society in general.\n\nBut with this sudden change now that the low income housing is right in the midst of Pentridge, people are scared and ready to pounce and acting as though this is some new threat and I am concerned that someone is going to get hurt from this kind of fear and anger.",

We are likely taking appliance batteries, not something bigger like, say, EV traction batteries, judging by the size of the property. Two additional warehouses next door caught fire too, with additional equipment being on fire.\n\nThe authorities responsible for \n1. Making stuff not burn.\n2. Making people safe from flame and smoke.\n3. Making sure stuff that can reignite or - as batteries do - reach a critical state and start a new ablaze - is kept under observation until deemed safe.\n.. did their thing.\n\nBig shout out to our firies.\n\nWhere we seem to have a big nasty hole we need to talk about is **the air**. \n\nI‚Äôm not talking about toxic **smoke**. I am talking about toxic **air**.\n\nThe EPA monitors this from sensor stations (nearest being Brighton I believe) but whose readings may not pick up what happened in cheltenham, because wind. \n\nFactories burn occasionally, it wouldn‚Äôt be their first rodeo, and they have the expertise and access to things like cars and the internet. So a working assumption is they‚Äôre across what‚Äôs going on. \n\nBut I don‚Äôt see them being transparent and sharing it.\n\nMy concern here, to reiterate, isn‚Äôt toxic smoke we can all see and avoid. \n\nIt‚Äôs the concern you‚Äôd have taking your kids into a poisoned air environment, where a short exposure can drastically shorten your life. One of many examples we all adequately fear and respect is a house whose asbestos walls got knocked down yesterday. No smoke. Air locks the same. You wouldn‚Äôt walk into that. \nThere are others, for example, if you ever worked around hydrazine in gas form. \n\nI don‚Äôt know - and most of us probably don‚Äôt - where, on the scale of burned timber to asbestos, the particles from a Li-Ion battery warehouse end up. Also how they spread, and where areas affected by the spread are. \n\nI‚Äôs like to know, so I can make good decisions.\n\nAnd all the EPA is giving us, instead of ‚Äúthis is the stuff, this is where it‚Äôs in the air, this is how long it‚Äôll take it to go‚Äù is absent data and ‚Äúnothing to see here, move along‚Äù. \n\nPerhaps this is as benign as a bushfire. Perhaps we‚Äôre closer to asbestos territory. But can we see some honest official assessment and  advice **before** we go blaze about it and settle on ‚Äòduck and cover‚Äô strategies? \n\n",

I am single, no dependents, etc. I am wanting to know a little about the realistic life of Melbourne. I have read through many things that are mostly positive, besides the cost of living, but I am wanting to know even more. Some background on me, I am originally from the midwestern U.S., but I have been teaching abroad in Mongolia. I am interested in Australia because of the climate (yes, I know Melbourne isn't warm year round, but it's warmer than Mongolia!), positive things I have read about teaching (including teacher pay), and the opportunity to travel to Australia. \n\nMy biggest concern in moving is the cost of living and the distance from the rest of the world. I am already 14 hours ahead of my family, so time zone isn't something I am scared of, but more the opportunity to travel around on breaks (more to SE Asia) and how easy it is to do that. In regards to pay, I would start as a substitute teacher, making around 401AUD per day (take home pay, after taxes, etc) and then would hopefully get contract work in January when the new school year starts. Is this original salary doable? I do have a small savings from living & working in an extremely cheap country (will leave here with around 3,000USD due to paying off my student debt), but I am concerned about savings potential and quality of life that will come with it.\n\nAny and all information you can provide would be great. I have never been to Australia, but am eager to hear more about it! TIA!",

        "text": "I've seen the word \"good HSP\" thrown around but I never quite sat down and thought about it. These are my opinions but feel free to share yours below! (Along with recommendations for places that do it \"right\") \n\nChips: Golden and crispy but not dry and grainy inside. Not dripping with grease and should be a nice solid dry base layer that carries the flavours of everything that will be layered on top\n\nSalt: generously layered right onto the fresh hot chips out of the fryer, but not too much where your blood pressure spikes with each bite. Should be a fragrant, umami \"chicken\" flavour that's not too overwhelmingly fake, and has a hint of sight sweetness.\n\nCheese: moderately sprinkled over the chips, allowing it to disperse evenly and melt down between the gaps. It shouldn't be a full pile of cheese in the middle, or too much of it, or it won't melt properly and overwhelm the flavour. Quality high milk fat cheese is ideal as it has a lower melting point and mild flavour that helps with neutralising the salt. \n\nMeat: the most important part. Should be high quality cuts of tender meat (slightly fatty if lamb), delicately spiced and lightly charred, resulting in a smoky fragrant aroma. Meat shavings are delicate with thin tapering ends, allowing for maximum crispness when seared on a hot, well seasoned griddle. \n\nSauces: More up to personal taste, but I go with a rich buttery garlic sauce that helps with the salt, chilli sauce that's genuinely hot and gives a great kick to the HSP, and a sweet bbq to provide additional sweetness and acidity to cut through the heavier flavours.\n\nAs for my favourite place, very few have managed to hit all the right criteria, but my vote goes to Crazy Kebabs in Braybrook. HSPs are perfect and the owner is super warm and welcoming to boot! \n\nMmmh.... Are you hungry yet?? ",

They all seem to be the same price-wise (and I'm not fussed about it being a dollar per pod). My priorities are freshness and quality to get the best possible extraction and crema from a pod.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

Lots of people mostly wearing completely white, but with colourful neck wear, like necklaces or kind of collars on the white shirts? \n\n\n\n\n\nI was sitting across the other side of the river for a while (after driving past but finding no parking), so didn‚Äôt get a chance to ask any attendees. However, there was really nice music/chanting, sort of similar to traditional trance music from Morocco, or like a Sufi dhikr song or something (however, I do not think it was a Sufi festival, I‚Äôm just commenting more on the quality of the trance singing, which sounded like it was being done by one man accompanied by a band).\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I would be really curious if anyone knows what the gathering was‚Ä¶ It was quite intriguing and cool to listen to. \n\n\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\nEdit: typo",

I think after this, we ended up talking for five or ten minutes or so about books and he told me about how he had a whole list of books from this leadership mentoring group he was in and even gave me a recommendation (The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday for anyone interested). It might be silly, but I really appreciated how he took an interest in me with what I was studying, doing for work, and the stack of books I was carrying. I even genuinely laughed a few times at some jokes he cracked.\n\nThis was probably wasn‚Äôt as special for him as it was for me, but I‚Äôve always been a bit of a recluse and struggled to leave my house for anything that wasn‚Äôt classes. In fact, there were multiple periods of time last year where I wouldn‚Äôt even leave my house for weeks on end and it was only until recently I tried to get out a bit more, if not improve my health since I was so sedentary (and my gp said I should try to get more sunlight and fresh air). Just the day before, an older woman was asking about some of the classic literature I picked up at a Salvos (yes, I might have a book addiction), and that encounter was just as sweet.\n\nI know it‚Äôs always a risk to start up conversations with strangers, but I think it‚Äôs really worth a shot here and again if you can have nice encounters like this and for as daunting as it can be, I assure you there will be people like me who‚Äôll appreciate the conversation.\n\nSo thank you, Liam! It really made my day and I hope you managed to settle on a good book after I left.\n\nP.S. I thought you had a really cool backpack. Usually people go for more muted tones (me included), so I loved how bright and colourful yours was :)\n\nEdit: Oh wow, scratch what I said about nobody reading this because this post blew up a little. Honestly, thank you so much to everyone leaving such sweet and encouraging messages‚ÄîI'll definitely be putting myself out there a bit more to hopefully meet some nice people. As for everyone hoping that Liam might see this, as sweet as the sentiment is, I really do doubt that might happen and whether or not he'd even want to reach out again. But on the slim chance it does happen, I'll definitely make an update and I'd be more than happy to reconnect again to talk more about some books!\n\nAnyway, thank you again to everyone and I hope my story inspires you to maybe interact in small ways with more people :) (Also fixed some spelling mistakes in the original post)\n\n  \nEdit Again: We found him!! A friend of his found the post and shared it with him, so we're talking now. Thank you to everyone again for helping me to reconnect with Mr. Backpack, and we're both really glad that this post touched people! Have a great week, Melbourne! ",

We don't want to take them to their vet in the car, both of which distresses them, and therefore are looking for a mobile vet that can come to our home to minimise their stress. We aren't planning to have them go at the same time, but it could happen as their conditions deteriorate. Does anyone have any recommendations in the Boroondara area? Do you know if they can come at short notice if their quality of life swiftly degrades?\n\nThank you.\n\n  \nEdit: Just for anyone who may be looking for similar information in the future. Today (one week after we posted above), we said farewell to the first of our beautiful girls, Rosie. We decided in the end to go with Rest Your Paws as recommended by some of the comments below. I rung a couple of different places and although both seemed good, we ultimately went with them.  The girl I spoke with on the phone was empathetic and she was able to arrange a lovely vet to come to our house with barely 24 hours notice.  The vet who came, Dr Linda, was compassionate and gentle with our poor girl in her final moments.  She talked us through every step and didn't rush us.  We received a candle, a vial of her fur and an inked print of her paw.  We don't regret our decision in choosing Rest Your Paws and having our girl pass in the comfort of her home. It was so much less traumatic than taking her to the vet clinic in the car, which I've had to do before with a beloved pet a long time ago. She went peacefully in the garden, held in my son's arms, surrounded by her family and love. When it's time for our second beautiful girl, Jazz, we will use this company again.",

        "title": "Wrong Mail Mystery",
        "text": "Okay, this is a bit of a weird one, so I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone can work out what's going on..\n\nSince about late 2023, I started getting wrong  mail to my address. That's fine - people sometimes enter the wrong address. \n\nIt was a membership package for an AFL club - Essendon I think, and had the name 'Rohan Sunar' on it. \n\nAs it wasn't for me, I crossed out the address, wrote 'Return to Sender' on it and popped it back in the post to hopefully get back to the club. \n\nHowever, over the course of 2024, I ended up receiving AFL membership mail/packages from every AFL club (including Victorian/Interstate) - all to my address, but all addressed to this 'Rohan Sunar' \n\nThis then started to expand to a couple new names - 'Josh Valahis' and 'Charles Rex' - Josh turning up on more AFL memberships, and Charles appearing on NRL memberships packages, which started turning up early-mid 2024.\n\nWhile I was originally marking the mail as 'Return to sender - not at this address', I started contacting the AFL/NRL clubs by phone to inform them of this situation and try to explain how this was happening to multiple clubs. \n\nGenerally the people I spoke to were understanding, and would vow to do something about it, but I'm absolutely confused about what is going on. \n\nI assume there's a scam or something, but I honestly can't find the angle. \n\nMy thoughts are: \n1) If this was a prank, it's a very expensive one, with club memberships being in the hundreds of dollars each.. (why not just send someone free junk mail?) \n\n2) If it's stolen card details, this seems like an inefficient way to spend money, for stuff they don't receive? \n\n3) I've been living at my address for 4 years, and I was in touch with the old residents who were there from 2017 or so -none of them share the names on the memberships. \nAnd because this only started in 2023, it doesn't seem like someone accidentally forgot to update their address.. \n\n4) If it was a wrong address, signing up for every AFL/NRL club would have different signup forms, so would they have made the exact same mistake that many times over multiple years? \n\nSo - I'm kinda confused.  \n\nWhen I call the clubs, I do request that if they contact Rohan/Charles/Josh, if they work out what is happening to let me know to satisfy my curiosity, but I've never had a follow up yet.. \n\nI'm not overly concerned otherwise, and I just contact the clubs to inform them and send the packages back - but I'm just really interested in what on earth is going on!\n\nAny ideas? \n\n(Attached pic is the memberships that arrived in the last fortnight) ",

        "text": "So we got the keys to our new rental a little under a month ago and moved in a week ago. In the lease agreement it stated that there HAS been a mould issue in the past 3 years and noted: \"Roof leak, the roof has since been repaired by the insurer and certified as free of mould.\"  \n\nLast week (week 1 of our move in) we received a notice that an air quality test was needed to be carried out on the property and to sign off on a recent insurance claim. This raised some red flags so we inquired and discovered it was part of the supposed past mould issue. \n\n  \nToday, we were informed that Asp/Pen mould spores are present at an elevated level in our living room, which needs to be invasively investigated. We are having someone immediately set up an industrial air filtration machine in our living room. \n\n  \nI am fuming and am confident that the landlord / real estate company misled and breached our rental agreement by marking this issue as resolved - knowing that air quality tests still needed to be carried out. Had we known we would have never signed the lease. \n\n  \nWe are especially concerned since we have a small child and he has developed a rather bad respiratory infection over the past week as well. \n\n\n\nSo we are wondering what are options are here? Can we break the lease, get back our bond and expense any moving costs to the landlord? I work from home - so this is also going to impact that too. \n\n  \nAny advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Said if this was out of warranty would be max $1100 including the part ($700 part)...\n\nJust shows they even dont know what theyre doing.......\n\nHi All,\n\nI wanted to share my recent experience with Metropolitan Plumbing and Electrical/Mr Emergency to warn others about what I believe to be predatory and misleading practices.\n\nAll other names that link to the same ABN: [https://abr.business.gov.au/AbnHistory/View?id=89152593630](https://abr.business.gov.au/AbnHistory/View?id=89152593630)\n\nOn **23/12/2024**, I called them for an urgent issue with my 3-year-old ActronAir air conditioning unit. The first technician arrived, spent a few minutes turning the unit on at the wall, and diagnosed the fault as a **faulty PCB**. Without opening the unit or doing any in-depth inspection, he quoted **$2,049** for a ‚Äúrejuvenation.‚Äù Desperate to fix the issue due to my dog‚Äôs severe heart condition and the summer heat, I reluctantly agreed.\n\nThe second technician arrived and spent **no more than 40 minutes onsite**. During that time, he sprayed the outdoor unit with soap and water (using my hose), cleaned an already clean indoor filter, and confirmed the fault. **No vents were cleaned, no parts were replaced, and the PCB issue was not resolved.**\n\nWhen I received the invoice, it showed **$1,452.26 for labour** and **$228.65 for materials**‚Äîmaterials that consisted of soap and water I provided. I‚Äôve consulted several independent HVAC specialists since, all of whom confirmed this service should cost no more than **$500**.\n\nWhen I raised my concerns with Metropolitan Plumbing, they defended their ‚Äúfixed pricing‚Äù model and refused a refund, only offering to waive the $141.90 call-out fee. Their explanation did not justify the exorbitant cost for such minimal work.\n\nI feel this company took advantage of my desperation in a stressful situation, and their pricing is completely out of line with industry standards. I‚Äôve decided to escalate this matter to VCAT (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) and share my experience to prevent others from falling victim to similar practices.\n\nIf you‚Äôre considering using Metropolitan Plumbing and Electrical, please think twice. I‚Äôd also appreciate hearing if anyone else has had a similar experience. Let‚Äôs spread awareness and hold companies accountable for fair and honest service.\n\nSee below, they have the same company name for almost every suburb so a single \"review\" wont really affect the overall company..... so shady....\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsw6537ryw9e1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad266a543f769ff76d7e3c1e0f4904f6af65fd9c\n\nStay safe,",

People with biases citing biases are common on Reddit.\n\nI personally think there's just more hateful and very critical people on Reddit than IRL, so I wasn't surprised.\n\nI am 56, and don't stream anymore. I used Netflix during COVID and a little while after.  \nI watch FTA TV selectively, as the quality of programs and the lack of new interesting shows has diminished, as people have switched to their phones/streaming.  \nThere's still good shows amongst the dross.\n\nBut The Project and Q and A were two of the few remaining shows where people discussed current events, and they provided a great service to Australians.  \nI think many will miss these shows once they are gone.\n\nThe 'replacement' for The Project seems to be an 'A Current Affair' type of show.  \nI don't watch ACA, so it won't be something I will probably like.\n\nPatricia Karvelas was a great presenter.  \nI liked all the presenters on The Project.

But I would love quality, pretty winter tops with sufficiently long arms, too.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for getting winter wear in longer limb lengths in our local shops?

I like to avoid plastic fabrics as much as I can, for obvious reasons.\n\nAlso, if anyone knows of places that still sell pants outside of workwear and jeans that have short, regular, and long length options, that'd be so dope.

        "text": "Just reposting this from the NZ sub as I saw the OP asked for someone to post it here as they don't have access!\n\n[Australia vs New Zealand - Thoughts from my years in each country. : r/newzealand](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1km9jmc/australia_vs_new_zealand_thoughts_from_my_years/)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have been living in both Australia and New Zealand since COVID, working in both for various companies and traveling in both. Have made a bunch of friends in both countries and it's been awesome! I come from the UK, but have traveled all around the place.\n\nI saw someone posted a similar one for part of NZ, so just thought I would give my two cents on some really random observations between the two of you...... there will be lots of generalizations so take this all with a grain of salt...\n\n* **People:**¬†I don't think a lot of people from each country realize just how similar you both are..... like... it's kind of scary how similar you both are. There seems to be a lot of \"We do this\" without people realizing you both do it.\n* **Meat:**¬†New Zealand. Guessing it's grain fed vs grass... as Australian grass feed is basically the same as normal NZ. Definitely more variety in Australia however if you are in to eating random shit.\n* **Fruit:**¬†Australia has more variety and for longer periods. But New Zealand fruit seems to have so much more flavor for some reason.\n* **General Food/Drink Selection:**¬†Australia, not even close.\n* **General selection/shopping:**¬†Australia again by a long way. Granted you can order most things online these days without an issue.\n* **Chocolate:**¬†New Zealand: By a very very long way. Purely for having whittakers.\n* **Cost of Living:**¬†Australia generally.. \\*however\\* it's really not as far apart as a lot of people seem to think when it comes to groceries etc. Australia also has an awful lot more \"Other\" costs than NZ. While petrol is far cheaper for example, car rego etc is 10x the price. Cars are also far more expensive.\n* **Pies/Cakes/Bakery food:**¬†New Zealand by a lot. This was strange, was expecting more from Australia.\n* **Booze:**¬†New Zealand. FAR more variety and far more of a \"Experimental\" mindset.. can get everything you can imagine at awesome quality. Also far cheaper in NZ. (Except wine which seems to be cheaper in Australia)\n* **Scenery:**¬†While Australia has some utterly fantastic scenery.. New Zealand really takes first place on this one, it has everything and all so close to each other.\n* **Weather:**¬†100% depends on what you like. While Australia by far has more sunshine... some of that sunshine can be..... like standing in a large air fryer.\n* **Driving:**¬†You are both 100% shit as each other. New Zealanders seem to want to get as close to your ass as possible. Australians seem to not understand how indicators and lanes work.\n* **Salaries:**¬†Australia easy, however the \"Higher you get\" it seems to even out a lot more. Manual labor pays a lot more in Australia. Plus super etc.\n* **Public Transport:**¬†Australia easy. However I actually did find a lot of \"Rural\" NZ was better than \"Rural\" AU for public transport.\n* **Work Life:**¬†New Zealand. Seems a lot more friendly and together. Australian work culture is brutal and can wear you out from what I have experienced and heard this from many people who have worked in both countries.\n* **Roads:**¬†Australia easy... however none of them actually seem to help get anywhere faster.\n* **Traffic:**¬†New Zealand. Far less traffic everywhere.\n* **Cheese:**¬†Australia.... honestly by quite a bit.\n* **Coffee:**¬†New Zealand. By a very long way.\n* **Houses:**¬†Australia. Just seem of far better quality and far cheaper... although‚Ä¶ use more carpet Australia!\n* **Snow Sports:**¬†New Zealand, by a VERY long way. Just better and also far cheaper.\n* **Inclusivity:**¬†Cities in both countries are the same.. however when you get rural... New Zealand and not even close. Rural Australia can be like... the 1400s....\n* **Nationalism:**¬†Australians in generally seem FAR more \"Nationalistic\" than New Zealand.\n* **Location:**¬†New Zealand felt a lot more \"Remote\" than Australia.\n* **Crime:**¬†I honestly felt safer in New Zealand, however that wildly depending on where I was. The most \\*unsafe\\* I felt was in the Northern part of Australia. I also felt pretty unsafe in Rotorua.\n* **Formality:**¬†Bit of a random one, I found Australia to be a lot more formal in everything, New Zealand was a lot more chill. Not sure if either is better. Will depend on the person.\n\n**Funny Observation:**¬†New Zealanders living in Australia seem to think NZ is an absolute shithole. Australians in New Zealand seem to think AU is an absolute shithole. Yet both seem very proud of being an \"Aussie\" or a \"Kiwi\". It's very very strange...\n\n**Biggest Difference:**¬†Probably just how ingrained New Zealand is with the Maori Culture and how the Maori people are part of everything. Australia feels like \"We are trying to put in the bare minimum...\"\n\nBut yes, fantastic places, I don't think either of you know just how lucky you are to live where you do.\n\n**Note:**¬†I can't seem to post this in the Australian sub as there is a time limit re new accounts, but if someone could post this there that would be great! :)",

        "text": "St Stephen Chruch, Sydney. Saturday 3rd May 2025.\n\nThe venue was lovely ‚Äì a beautifully decorated church filled with candlelight, which created a warm and enchanting atmosphere. The setting was visually stunning, and the acoustics were decent, though nothing remarkable.\n\nThe Ash Quartet appeared to be a friendly and enthusiastic group, but their performance left much to be desired. It seemed under-rehearsed, as though they were unfamiliar with the pieces. There were frequent mistakes, uneven timing, and a general lack of cohesion. The cellist played reliably, and the violist offered a particularly rich and beautiful tone, easily the highlight of the group.\n\nUnfortunately, the violinists struggled throughout. The second violinist, in particular, got lost on several occasions and made repeated errors from beginning to end. Both violinists lacked the precision and expression expected at this price point. I have attended students concerts that were of better quality than this.\n\nGiven that we paid $100 for front-row seats, the musical quality simply did not justify the cost. If you're not especially into music, you might still enjoy the atmosphere and candlelit setting. But for anyone with musical training or experience attending classical, jazz, or Baroque concerts, this will likely be a disappointing experience.\n\nI did enjoy parts of the evening, mainly thanks to the setting, but I left feeling rather annoyed by how expensive it was for such a subpar performance. I've now booked premium tickets to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra‚Äôs *The Music of Joe Hisaishi* at the Opera House this September ‚Äì only $70 more. At the very least, I can expect a performance of the highest calibre.\n\nPS: You need to carefully read my review. I am not saying the performance sucked and it is all bad. I believe these days people aren't used to proper critics.\n\nPS2 :I'm all for supporting local artists and musicians. In fact, I've been attending every Strathfield Symphony Orchestra concert for the past 15 years. Tickets are $40 for two hours of classical music, conducted by the remarkable Sada and performed by a mix of professional and semi-professional musicians.\n\nI also regularly attend concerts in Sydney, Penrith and Wollongong, organised by their respective conservatoriums. In addition, I frequently go to jazz concerts hosted by SIMA, as well as performances in larger venues.\n\nThe concert I attended on Saturday night was simply not worth the $100 ticket price.\n\nI once attended a Candlelight concert in Paris, at Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis' Church, performed by an international string quartet and a professional opera singer, and the ticket only were 20 euros. I‚Äôve also been to free concerts held in various churches around the city. In fact, St Stephen‚Äôs offers lunchtime performances every Friday. Simply lighting a few candles does not justify such a high ticket price.\n\nIn a nutshell my point is : not a bad night not worth the $100 I paid for nor is it worth the $60 for the cheapest tickets.

        "text": "Has anyone had the same issue I‚Äôve had in the past couple of months and been unable to get any sauce out with those red squeeze bottles of tomato sauce? \n\nI‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a conspiracy, but I‚Äôve bought Rosella, Fountain, Masterfood recently and all of them I‚Äôve had the same issue: I get the new bottle, screw off the nozzle, pull off the white plastic seal, screw the nozzle back on , open up the nozzle and then squeeze, shake, twist, turn, try all angles, but just no sauce is coming out! \n\nI‚Äôm seriously losing my mind. I‚Äôve been an avid sauce user for over 40 years now and seen the transition from glass bottles to these plastic red nozzle squeeze bottles, to even the clear plastic white lid - store the bottle upside down - varieties, and never had this issue I‚Äôm having now till recently.\n\nSo the bottle I‚Äôm talking about are those red nozzle, eggplant shaped red colour plastic bottles. All the big brands seem to use the same type of bottle and nozzle now for this variety on the supermarket shelf. But when I squeeze it, whether it‚Äôs brand new and on the first squeeze, half full, or almost empty, it‚Äôs like the sauce become air locked inside and refuses to come out. And I‚Äôm starting to take it personally!\n\nAnd no, it‚Äôs not any dried up sauce in the nozzle causing the issue. I know that old one - the dried up tomato sauce that you sometimes have to peel off from the end of the nozzle, or for the untrained - when you squeeze the bottle, the sauce shoots out at an odd angle, missing the plate and trying its best to hit you on the leg or shirt. No, no, this is a new issue. I‚Äôve screwed off the nozzle, rinsed it under the tap, cleaned it up good and proper, even put a pair of pliers on to it so force the two parts of the nozzle apart, and confirmed it‚Äôs not a sauce build up issue, it has to be the nozzle!\n\nSo, please, anyone else recently experiencing this? I feel I‚Äôm being personally attacked by Big Sauce. \n\nMy thoughts are currently:\n- there‚Äôs a bad batch of nozzles going around where the inject moulding machine has accidentally closed off the return airway, causing a vacuum seal with the sauce squeezing \n- the red plastic bottle has changed somehow and the squeeze technique has created a new fluid-mechanics phenomena that is preventing viscous fluids moving outwards under pressure. \n- the sauce from Rosella, Fountain and Masterfoods are actually all the same sauce from the same factory and their new recipe is just unable to move through the nozzle. \n\nI‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs the nozzle. And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all the same nozzle that all the brands are using. Looking at my current Rosella bottle, I see the nozzle is marked with the branding by Cormack Sydney Au3 Pat 4, 967, 941. I don‚Äôt know how this Cormack person is, but I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs their doing. Something has changed in their nozzle technology recently and we the customer are paying for it. They‚Äôre forcing us to remove the nozzle and - gasp! - free pour from an open lid of sauce. Now we are over using our sauce and now forced to buy more bottles on our weekly shop. \n\nAnyways, I think I‚Äôve lost my mind on this one. Please let me know if anyone else has recently experienced this? Or if there is a new technique required to get the sauce out?\n\nPlease help!",

        "title": "Remembering the Yarra Brothers",
        "text": "Far away from their homeland of Australia, brothers Flight Lieutenant John Yarra DFM, 21, and then-Sergeant Robert Yarra, 19, pose with Flt.Lt. Yarra‚Äôs Spitfire, *Ned V*, between September and December 1942.\n\nFlt.Lt. Yarra‚Äôs aircraft were named ‚ÄòNed‚Äô after his girlfriend, Doreen Brown. He had been flying in combat since November 1941, when he began flying fighter sweeps over Nazi-occupied France in a Spitfire with No. 64 SQN of the British Royal Air Force. In January 1942, he was transferred to No. 249 SQN RAF, and in March he took off from the aircraft carrier HMS *Eagle* to reinforce Malta - an island only a quarter the size of Sydney that had over 6,700 tons of bombs dropped on it.\n\nDue to a shortage of Spitfires, John Yarra was transferred to No. 185 SQN RAF, flying the old but reliable Hurricane fighter. However, the squadron would eventually receive Spitfires of its own in May. While defending Malta, John shot down at least 12 Axis aircraft - 7 Bf 109 fighters, 2 C.202 fighters, 2 Re.2001 fighters, and a Ju 88 bomber. He also damaged two Bf 109s and two Re.2001s, and probably shot down another Ju 88 and another Bf 109.\n\nOn one occasion, after shooting down one or two Bf 109s, John defended some of his comrades, who had been shot down and were floating defencelessly in the water, from Axis fighters attempting to kill them. Despite having no ammunition left in his fighter, he was able to force the enemy aircraft to retreat, and had just enough fuel left to return to base.\n\nIn July, John was sent back to England, and in September he joined the Royal Australian Air Force‚Äôs No. 453 SQN as a flight leader. The squadron was largely made up of inexperienced Australian pilots, one of whom was John‚Äôs younger brother, Sergeant Robert Yarra, who had been a surfer and footballer before the war, and would go on to represent his squadron in boxing tournaments.\n\nAmong the missions flown by No. 453 SQN were armed reconnaissance missions against German coastal shipping. One such mission was flown on December 10th, 1942. No. 453 SQN‚Äôs war diary states:\n\n>Unfortunately it was necessary to record the loss of Flt.Lt. JW Yarra and Plt. Off. MHI de Cosier of B-Flight. They were one of three sections, which went on shipping reconnaissance in the area Blankenberge ‚Äì Flushing and at about 11.45 hours four merchant ships, each of 700 ‚Äì 1000 tons and protected by a Flakship, were sighted some 10 miles north-west of Flushing and all were heavily armed. The attack had good results! One of the merchants was heavily damaged and left burning fiercely, a large pall of black smoke rising to 150 feet being seen in the short time the departing aircraft had it under observation. The aircraft of Flt.Lt. Yarra and Plt.Off. de Cosier were both hit! Plt.Off. de Cosier stalled and dived into the sea, while he was trying at a very low speed to gain height. Flt.Lt. Yarra climbed to approximately 1000 feet and bailed out but hit and became caught in the tailplane and his parachute came out but streamed behind the aircraft. The pilot became disengaged before the aircraft hit the sea in flames and was seen to fall into the water with the parachute streaming behind him unopened. Neither body has been recovered and therefore the official report is Missing believed Killed. It must be said, however, that not the slightest hope for either can be entertained. The other sections were concerned Plt.Off. EAR Beau, Plt.Off. RJ Darcey and Plt.Off. LJ Hansell and Sgt. G. Stansfield. All pressed home their attack with vigor and special credit must be given to Plt.Off. Beau, who took command after Flt.Lt.Yarra had been shot down, and brought his four aircraft safely back.\n\nFlight Lieutenant John Yarra was 21 years old when he was killed. Before he died, he had written a letter to his mother that was to be read in the event of his death.\n\n>I entered this war with the knowledge that I had a rather small chance of coming out of it alive. I was under no false impression, I knew I had to kill and perhaps be killed. Since I commenced flying I have spent probably the happiest time of my life ‚Ä¶ Above all, Mother dear, I have proved to my satisfaction that I was, at least, a man.\n\nPilot Officer Bill de Cosier was 20 years old.\n\nDespite the loss of two of his comrades, one of whom was his own brother, Robert had to carry on. By April 1944, he had been commissioned as a Pilot Officer and appointed as the intelligence officer of No. 453 SQN, and was responsible for planning the squadron‚Äôs missions. One such mission may have been Ramrod 735, an attack by No. 453 SQN and No. 602 SQN RAF, escorted by No. 132 SQN RAF, against German V1 cruise missile launching sites in France, which were being used to launch indiscriminate attacks against British civilians. \n\nRamrod 735 took place on April 14th, 1944. No. 602 SQN attacked first, with success and without loss. They were followed by No. 453 SQN, which had to face the now-alerted German anti-aircraft defences. Pilot Officer Robert Yarra‚Äôs aircraft was hit by multiple high-explosive shells and destroyed. He was 21 years old.\n\nFlight Lieutenant John Yarra and Pilot Officer Robert Yarra died defending Britain, Australia, and, in fact, the entire world from the evil of Nazism. Both were only 21 years old when they were killed. They had so much of life left to live, and it was all lost in an instant.\n\nThey were survived by their father, WWI veteran Alfred Yarra, their mother, Harriet Yarra, and their brother, James Yarra. Their father may have been Gunner Alfred Yarra MM, and their brother may have been Private James Yarra of the 2/9th Infantry Battalion, who survived WWII.\n\nSources:\n\n- https://making-history.ca/2020/02/10/mrs-harriet-yarras-war/\n- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yarra\n- https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/194605633\n- https://vwma.org.au/explore/people/653417\n- https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/42047565\n- https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1531589\n- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)",

Is this a good car for the distance or will I constantly be stressed about the battery life and small tank?\n\nI'm also considering the diesel Kia Sportage, which obviously isn't a PHV, so the distance concern goes away for the same price, but I like the interior and build quality of the BYD.",

        "text": "So for context, my local APM cycles through workers very often and I am unfortunately used to being passed around the office, never really getting a chance to progress with spoken plans with a worker as a new one replaces them by the time any motion gets motioning. Despite this, I try to just remain patient and get to know the new APM worker that I am designated each time this happens. HOWEVER!!! This newest worker, we will call her C, has been the worst worker I have had yet. She hounds me to let her know if I ever need \"help\" (?) applying for work. Yes, HOUNDS. Multiple times a week, every week, over the phone, via email, and in person. \n\nI have made it clear that I do not need any hand-holding and that if I am ever in need of help I will let her know. On its own, this doesn't sound bad at all, but I am severely underexaggerating how much she does it and how often I have had to say NO. I have read online that APM workers will try to claim credits for jobs you get, so I am a bit suspicious of her for this reason. Maybe this is why she wants to so desperately be involved in the process.\n\nBack on topic- This email was addressed to Zeus Street Greek, from her, COMPLETELY impersonating me, with her lying about my current job role (that I just secured for myself!) as if I no longer work there, giving out very personal details of mine to this complete stranger, and even just lodging this application on my behalf in general is weird within itself as again she did not seek my permission AT ALL!! \n\n(would also like to add that in my entire history of being with APM, I have always made it very clear I am not comfortable working with food, zero exceptions, which has never been an issue for my worker or for myself, making this even weirder!)\n\nIs there something I can do about this? I will definitely be requesting a new worker which is surprisingly something I have never done before, but other than that, can I lodge some kind of complaint? Is this behaviour from APM workers normal and I'm the weird one for only experiencing this now? What can I even do about this?\n\nMostly just posted this to rant my frustrations, but I would genuinely love to hear what you have to think. Thanks",

As pointed out by you, there is a fine of $1100 I am claiming. The other is a request for rent reduction due to the faulty air-conditioning system since December (few months without AC now)\n\nI'm also considering lodging a formal complaint on fair trading as suggested here, but haven't done it yet.\n\nI have also used a few other sites to inform myself like:\n\nhttps://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/act-2010-042\n\nhttps://www.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-construction/rules/urgent-repairs-residential-rental-properties\n\nThose were relevant to my case, so don't limit yourselves in case you need different information. \n\nI also got in touch with legal aid and tenants services or tenants union.\n\nhttps://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/\nhttps://www.tenants.org.au/tu/tenants-services-australia\n\nIf you are having a bad time with your real estate the one thing I recommend you do is ask to move all communications to email, as written conversations are easier to follow-up and hold them responsible for. Calls and in person chats are easy to be misunderstood or forgotten (or whatever is convenient to them). Also, they are masters in deceiving and spreading misinformation.\n\nOur hearing is at the end of the month, and I will update you with the outcome and maybe share some of the emails if you are interested üòÄ \n",

Flight AN152 was a A320-211 VH-HYI which left Perth just before midnight on March 4 and arrived at Sydney Airport on March 5 at 6:53am local time.\n\nThe airline was founded in 1935 and unfortunately had to cease operations due to a number of factors including heavy competition from Qantas & other low cost carrier airlines, an aging fleet of planes, maintenance issues, and having one of the best paid staff in the airlines industry in Australia.\n\nAir New Zealand acquired full ownership of the airline in 2000 however a series of poor financial decisions prior to taking full ownership (previously they were a 50% shareholder) meant it was not a good deal and not sustainable which they found out after the fact. As such, Air New Zealand was forced to put the airline into voluntary administration and a later attempt to sell the airline was unsuccessful.\n\nHappy 90th Birthday Ansett.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I just had a strange encounter at the servo and it raised a question for me that I hope you can answer.\n\nSuper busy station today, I pulled behind a person who wasn't actively filling their car - I've always figured if you weren't fulling your car then you were inside paying. So I wait. There was a long line, so I figured it would take a few minutes and then they'll be back in the car and moving off. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nFirst, two kids exit and jump in the car - and when the car door opened I could clearly see a third kid. I'm thinking cool, the older boy must have been paying while mum kept the car running. It is really hot after all, some air-conditioning while waiting must be nice. \n\nThen, a young man exits the servo, heads over, and hops in the front. So I'm like cool, that's 5, they can't be waiting on anyone else. At this point,  u have cars banked up behind me - they can't get past due to the design, and I don't  have room to manoeuvre out and around to try zip into one of the open pumps from the other side.\n\nSo we wait. And wait. And wait. \n\nEventually I turn my car off and go see what the fuck is the hold up. I asked the driver what the problem was, and I shit you not she looks up from her phone and says she is waiting to pay. Waiting to fucking pay?? I think my brain stopped working at this point, like, what?\n\nI asked her to confirm she hasn't paid, and is waiting. She says she is waiting, but she will pull forward so I can get petrol. I said I didn't think I could use the pump before she has paid, and she very patronisingly said that I could use it. \n\nSo, a few things here. I've always been under the impression that you were not supposed to move your car before paying for your petrol, and the few times I have witnessed someone using the pump before the person before them has paid it has always caused issues in the servo. Admittedly, this was a long time ago. Does anyone know if filling your car before someone else has paid for their fuel is fine? Does it cause any issues?\n\nAnd like, even if this woman was right and it's fine to do, why the fuck would she just sit there while all these cars are waiting for her to move her shitbox??\n\nSo I told her she was a moron, drove away cranky once I could get out, and I still need petrol. #winning\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who commented, great to know that filling up before the person before me has paid is totally okay, just not preferred (for the person moving off early). I feel much better after my rant, but I really would have felt better staying and getting my petrol instwad of driving off in a huff XD\n\nI don't know what her thought process was, and to be fair, I don't know what her circumstances are. I still think she's bonkers, but I'm going to move on. Thank you all for taking the time to read and comment <3",

I plan on contacting woolworths about it.",

        "text": "Anthony Ruskin-Rowe was born in Double Bay, NSW, on May 4th, 1919, the son of Harry Ruskin-Rowe and Vera Ruskin-Rowe (n√©e Connell). He enlisted in the RAAF on April 21st, 1941, at the age of 21.\n\nOn October 30th, he became engaged to Enid Board. Tragically, she was killed just over a month later on December 9th, 1941, when the unarmed ship she was travelling on was sunk by a Japanese submarine. Twenty-three others were killed, including an 18 month-old baby. \n\nThen-Leading Aircraftman Ruskin-Rowe was training in Canada at the time, but by July 1942 he was flying combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe with No. 131 SQN RAAF. In August, however, he requested to be sent home to Australia in order to fight the Japanese. His request was denied at the time. However, on December 2nd - a week short of the anniversary of his fianc√©e‚Äôs death - he was able to embark on a voyage back to Australia.\n\nHe was transferred to No. 452 SQN RAAF, which began flying in defence of northern Australia in January 1943 as part of No. 1 Wing RAAF, which was made up of No. 452 SQN, No. 457 SQN, and No. 54 SQN RAF.\n\nAt 0955 on June 20th, six Spitfires of No. 452 SQN took off from Strauss Airfield to join the rest of the wing in intercepting 21 Japanese bombers and their 21 fighter escorts. They found the enemy formation 10 miles north of Cape Hotham, NT, at an altitude of 22,000ft (6.7km), heading for Winnellie and RAAF Darwin. The defending Allied pilots shot down nine bombers and five fighters, the most shot down in a single engagement during the defence of northern Australia. \n\nHowever, this came at a price. While No. 457 SQN suffered no losses, and records for No. 54 SQN could not be found, No. 452 SQN lost two pilots. Pilot Officer William Nichterlein and Pilot Officer Anthony Ruskin-Rowe were both killed in action. Pilot Officer Ruskin-Rowe‚Äôs body was not recovered until either the 11th or 15th of July, 1943, when the site of his aircraft‚Äôs crash was located with the aid of local First Nations people. Surviving footage from the aircraft‚Äôs on-board camera indicated that he had shot down a Japanese bomber before his death.\n\nBoth he and Pilot Officer Nichterlein were only 23 years old.\n\nLest we forget.\n\nAmong the sources used in writing this were:\n\n- https://www.pittwateronlinenews.com/Anthony-T-Ruskin-Rowe-Spitfire-Pilot-1919-To-1943.php\n- https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/air_raids/darwin\n- recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=1160749 (National Archives of Australia item A9186, 143), page 141.",

But when asking questions, ordering in bars, cafes etc, I had a lot of people would freeze, stop, and look confused and be like 'Sorry, what?\"  \"Huh?\" \"Can you repeat that?\"\n\nI would repeat myself. I'd get asked again to clarify. Then I would. Articulate. Every. Word. Very. Pre-cise-ly. And make sure to say hard R's and pronounce every consonant. Only then would they understand. Once this initial communication was established, they then seemed to be able 'shift' to comprehend this type of English and they didn't have trouble understanding me for the rest of the convo.\n\nA couple of folks I AirBNB'd at were South American and Spanish expats. They told me this is a common thing in the USA, mostly because, unlike Europe and countries of the Commonwealth, American TV and media does not feature a lot of non-American English shows. So Americans at large are not exposed to a lot of accents at a young age like we are (Aussie, British, Scottish, Irish, Kiwi, American, Canadian). We also have some foreign content (SBS) that we probably watch more per capita than US people do.\n\nI did find it frustrating sometimes.

So in December of Last Year I moved out from a unit in NSW after spending two and a half hours cleaning my room + time spent in the bathroom removing mould, grime and cobwebs.\n\nThere was a notable stain on the carpet, a somewhat damaged mattress and a cracked window but\n\n1) the stain was there before I moved in and was impossible to reasonably remove\n\n2) the window was cracked before my arrival and the landlord had refused to repair it unless I secured a repairman and quote for him to work off of (after about three weeks of waiting after I r brought it up)\n\n3) I agreed the mattress was busted and assented to that being deducted from the bond (he disclosed this before the cleaning started and I can‚Äôt fault it)\n\nI then handed over my keys and he said once a quote for the cleaners had been acquired he‚Äôd contact me with notice of the remaining bond. I called earlier that day and mentioned I‚Äôd be happy to do any additional work if so required and later that day informed him I‚Äôd be happy to find a cleaner and quote for him. No response was made to either of these messages and this is in writing on my end.\n\nI called him today on a whim (knew I likely wasn‚Äôt getting anything but for closure) and he not only was quite combative about further damages (something about an odour that he made no mention of after I cleaned the room or in the roughly 60 days since) and also claimed I was not only short 100 dollars rent (I wasn‚Äôt, I calculated specifically how much I paid on a monthly basis, ensured it was square and asked him to inform me otherwise if there was an issue) but also attempted to claim 3 or four more weeks as reparations for the alleged stench‚Äôs impact on his business.\n\nI can confirm a stench existed and was mentioned previously, something I had worked to remedy with air fresheners (which he invariably complained about), cleaners (which he invariably complained about) and my own work (which he assented to but claimed was still somewhat present) but he made no comment on such after my clean was conducted and I handed off the keys in person. Considering the lack of a legal contract binding such (it was an advertised room on gumtree and a strictly cash affair), the passing of 60 days and the failure to repair a broken window from before my move; I don‚Äôt think he has any grounds to pursue action but I wanted to check here first.\n\nDoes my landlord have any case to be made or am I in the clear?  If not, what needs to be done to erase or solve the issue",

        "text": "This is a very minor complaint in the realm of issues affecting Australia, but I find this one mind boggling.\n\nWhen I was a kid in the 2000s-2010s, we‚Äôd sit down every Friday and Saturday to watch whatever movie was playing. It played exactly how the movie would on DVD (sometimes I‚Äôd compare the DVD to the version playing on TV to see how much time the ads would add).\n\nBut nowadays, every time I turn on the TV and a movie is playing, everything is moving too fast and their voices are pitched to the point where they sound like chipmunks. They must be playing at least 5% or more faster than the original copies and it blows my mind! It‚Äôs so distracting and I can‚Äôt enjoy it!\n\nI understand that other countries have done this to fit the movies into the schedule. But why has this suddenly happened in the last few years? What brought this change? Is it that less people at watching TV and they‚Äôre trying to cram more in? That seems counterproductive??\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?? Or am I going crazy?? üòÖ",

        "text": "We're in the final weekend now for the first grand slam of the year. Australia goes under the spotlight for a bit over 2 weeks when a new year comes along. It's publicity on an unprecedented scale - our country is broadcasted to 190+ countries and a global audience - but that also shows the \"not so good\" with the good. \n\nSo, how did Australia do this year. Some of my highlights-\n\n‚Ä¢ Singles wise, De Minaur was the lone bright star. The others in both genders fell off the radar quite quick.  \n‚Ä¢ De Minaur however was absolutely no match for Sinner in the quarters. Outclassed, he's improving but still a way from the title.  \n‚Ä¢ Double Ks were both injured after their respective singles losses and retired in their first doubles game.  \n‚Ä¢ Kyrgios kind of retiring from singles after his first round loss.  \n‚Ä¢ Ticketing fiasco saw the all Aussie mixed doubles final played in a nearly empty stadium.  \n‚Ä¢ The hecking of opponents playing Aussies at John Cain Arena needs to stop. Seen again in the Kokkinakis game which required the chair umpire to intervene repeatedly.  \n‚Ä¢ Danielle Collins took offense to Aussies supporting the local player and overdid her celebrations when she won. Was booed off when Keys sent her home in the next round.   \n‚Ä¢ The Aussie heat nearly had Sinner fainting on the court in round 4. With multiple of our arenas having roof and air-conditioning, maybe we don't need the rain to close the roof. Heat can kill this tournament.   \n‚Ä¢ Channel 9 embarassing the fuck out of themselves when their reporter needlessly heckled Serbian fans. Djokovic refused to do an on-court interview till the reporter apologised, which he did.   \n‚Ä¢ Djokovic playing a semi final with injury and retired after the first set with a muscle tear. The crowd booing an injured player off the court because they didn't get their money's worth made headlines all over the world and embarassed the fuck out of everybody. Shameful.  \n‚Ä¢ Record crowd at Australian Open as the tomorrow continues to grow.    \n‚Ä¢ It's great this remains on FTA. But Channel 9 switching between channels and 9Now having zero highlights of games is a letdown everytime.  \n‚Ä¢ Maybe it's just me, but the on-court interviews have been a bit cringe. They have been long, often not funny and a bit all over.  \n‚Ä¢Telly commentary has been poor too. The male commentators (including McEnroe) kept talking while a point was being played.  \n‚Ä¢Sabalenka is in her third consecutive AO final. Judging by the fact she's only lost two games at Rod Laver Arena, and one of them was to Ash Barty, one can't help but wonder if Ash was still playing, if she'd be playing for the title tonight.   \n\nOverall, I'd say a mixed tournament. Some great tennis, a local star is on the rise, a mixed doubles title, but our crowds must be better. The spotlight of the world is upon us, and often the heckling and the booing is unwarranted and a dick move. \n\nBest men's singles game would be Djokovic vs Alcaraz while women's singles would Keys vs Swiatek.",

After a hot december and January, most peoples filters will be well past due if they have not done it.\n\nAnd if you have a split system, take a torch and shine it up inside and take a look at the drum fan. if it looks something like [this](https://southeastelectrical.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/air-conditioner-cleaning-gold-coast-dirty-air-con-1.jpg) or worse, mouldy like [this](https://spotlesscleanair.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dirty-mouldy-aircon.jpg) then you should get your unit professionally cleaned.\n\nluckily that is pretty cheap, companies  can do a split system for $90-$180 depending on the level of filth. same for ducted. there are plenty of reputable companies about.\n\nJust, for the love of ALL that is holy, never, ever use Fallon, wherever you are in Australia, just don't.\n\nsome basic instructional videos\n\ncleaning a split system filters\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6M2Z8kUws\n\nif they are greasy, you can wash the filters in soapy water\n\ncleaning a ducted system\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DFlgWkiReE\n\nif you have box style window unit, you just need to lift the front panel to access the filter.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3zOLp44qeo\n\nif you are in a rental, I would not do a ducted system, the owner should be getting them cleaned.\n\nsplit system or box system filters, go for it, but if you see mold or grunge on the fans, you probably need to call in a professional.\n\ndon't forget that your car has air filters too! so if you air con has been lackluster in the car, try changing that as well.\n\nno matter your make or model, there will be a youtube video showing you how to do it. most models are easy, some are ridiculous are make you understand why a mechanic charges $120 for a cabin air filter change sometime.\n\nenjoy breathing clean air and stay cool, clean filters mean lower running costs too.\n\n\nI'm going to post this through all the city reddits I can find, so you might see it a few times.\n\n\n*edit, after being accused, I removed a reference to the company I used up in Brisbane.  this post was about getting people to clean their filters to breathe cleaner air and save money. I'm not trying to drum up business for a particular company.",

I met the most wonderful people, experienced breathtaking nature, and had the absolute time of my life. It was nothing short of magical.\n\nSince returning to Germany, not a single day goes by without me thinking about Australia. Every. Single. Day. I‚Äôve realized just how unhappy I am here compared to how incredibly happy I was back then. Sure, my lifestyle as a backpacker was unique and special, but that‚Äôs not the only reason. The quality of life in Australia is just on another level ‚Äì the weather, the beaches, the nature, and especially the people.\n\nAustralia also gave me my first car, a 1999 Mitsubishi Pajero, which became my home on wheels for a whole year. That car took me safely across the country, and it holds such a special place in my heart. Unfortunately, I missed the chance to take a physical keepsake from it.\n\nNow I‚Äôm wondering: is there any way I can get a replica of that number plate with the same letters and digits? I‚Äôve tried finding someone to make one, but all I‚Äôve come across are plastic versions or plates without embossed letters.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea or know someone who could help?

Taxis  \nThis industry was distorted by the limited licences that were tightly held and/or traded as assets.  \nMany taxi drivers were just employees for the licence holders.  \nThe taxi fares were mostly going to the licence holders.  \nUber comes along and 'disrupts' the industry, and taxi riders hail them as champions.  \nThen it turns out they are just as bad as the taxi licence holders.  \nThe Vic. Govt. deregulates the taxi industry and we have drivers acting like Uber drivers with 'surge' pricing.  \nSomething that never existed prior to Uber.  \nSo at the end of the 'experiment', taxi riders are worse off as far as prices go.\n\nIf the Govt. created a Taxi app that actually let anyone with a car become a taxi driver and keep 100% of a set price, this would mean more drivers and lower prices.\n\nIt maybe a but simplistic, and I'm sure all the Reddit pedants will give 50 reasons why it's a bad idea, but I think its worth looking at.\n\nIf there were non-profit apps for these types of services it would put these 'silicon valley' 'robber barons' out of business, lower prices, and give the people who actually do the work, 100% of the profits.\n\nExamples of apps needed:  \nUber/Lyft replacement  \nAirBNB/Stayz replacement  \nReal Estate/Domain replacement  \nTicketmaster/Ticketek replacement  \nTrivago/Booking replacement",

It was diluted and the driver I was with also noticed that it looked a bit strange and asked me if I'd mistakenly got a vanilla. Nope, vanilla shakes have way more flavor than this crap. \n\nNever again. Ever. Last time I buy a shake from Maccas. The burger was fine. The shake was watered down likely because the manager didn't give a shit they had to pump out a heap of shakes but didn't bother to check flavour levels or if they did they didn't care. \n\nWell the loss is on them cuz I won't be going back there.

        "text": "Tis the season for buying stuff so I thought I‚Äôd write up a guide on how to buy decent leather goods and see through marketing jargon. I‚Äôve been a professional leatherworker for six years and want to see our local industry supported over the many importers of mass produced junk. This is written from an Australian perspective, other countries would have different terminology.\n\nAny leather product you buy will be made from one of the following:\n\n**PU and some Vegan Leather**  \nA woven or knitted fabric is coated with polyurethane then sprayed with a smooth coloured layer and stamped with a leather grain pattern. This is the cheapest nastiest stuff. If you‚Äôve seen a couch with all the colour peeling off it, you‚Äôve seen PU leather.\n\n**‚ÄùGenuine Leather‚Äù and Bonded Leather**  \nLeather production generates a lot of waste, some of which is ground up, mixed with a binder and pressed into a sheet to create bonded leather. The process is similar to turning timber into chipboard. This has some legitimate applications, but the most common application is use in ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù products. If you‚Äôve ever bought a leather belt only for it to crack, revealing what looks like recycled paper inside, you‚Äôve dealt with ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù. Because the fibres that give leather strength have been chopped up, the material is weak and once the thin layer of split leather (see below) cracks, the whole thing falls apart.\n\n**Split Leather**  \nCow hides are usually around 6mm thick after processing. To bring that down to a useful thickness the hides are split, separating the top grain (the smooth side) from the fibrous flesh side. The leftover fibrous layer (called a split) can be sprayed and stamped to look like top grain leather. The looser fibres are weaker and the surface coating (called pigment) can wear through, making it a lower quality leather. A hide can be split many times to extract more value. Very thin splits are used in cheap belts and wallets so they can be advertised as using real leather, but they‚Äôre too thin to offer any strength and longevity. Splits are used by more high end brands than you‚Äôd expect.\n\n**Top Grain, Full Grain, Solid Leather**  \nThis is the good stuff. The grain layer is the thin top layer that is smooth, tight and protects the fibrous layers below. The fibres closest to the grain are tightest and strongest and where leather gets its strength.\n\n**Other Categories**\n\n**Suede**  \nGood quality suede is top grain, with the very top layer removed. You still have the tight, strong fibres, minus the smooth surface. Bad quality suede is just a split without pigmenting. Welding aprons and gardening gloves are made from this.\n\n**Vegan Leather (Mushroom, Cactus, Pineapple etc.)**  \nThis is typically a plant fibre, bonded together with a synthetic binder, pressed into a sheet, sprayed and stamped. They don‚Äôt require animal products, but do require synthetic additives, so I‚Äôm unsure if they‚Äôre a genuine alternative, or just greenwashing. Until they‚Äôve been tested out in the world for a few more years, I would steer clear.\n\n**Kangaroo Leather**  \nThis is the strongest leather, by thickness, in the world. It‚Äôs naturally about 1mm thick, making it ideal for small products that need to be strong but thin. Nike uses it for soccer boots and I use it for wallets for that reason.\n\n**Pigmented Leather**  \nIf leather needs to be a very consistent colour, brighter than natural or if the tannery wants to cover up marks they can send hides through a spray booth to received what is essentially a spray painted layer. This is very common with mass produced products and upholstery. Eventually the pigment will wear off.\n\n**Corrected Grain**  \nIn addition to pigmenting, one tactic to hide the scars and marks on a hide is to sand back the grain, pigment it then stamp it with a ‚Äúleather pattern‚Äù. A hide naturally has better and worse areas. Correcting the grain and pigmenting allows manufacturers to use an entire hide, regardless of the quality.\n\n**What to look out for when buying**\n\n**Provenance**  \nIf possible, buy directly from a craftsman who can trace their supply chain rather than a big retail store. Even better if they buy from tanneries that have high environmental and ethical standards and aren‚Äôt sourcing leather from India, Bangladesh etc. Leather is a filthy industry and needs to be strictly regulated to prevent waterways and workers being poisoned. There‚Äôs a good reason why I only buy from Austanners in Geelong and Packer in Brisbane. Supply chains are important.\n\n**Surface finish and feel**  \nIf it‚Äôs a super bright colour, feels plasticky, is entirely consistent with no variation in colour or markings, then it has been processed more than I recommend. Scars, colour variation and growth lines are just part of leather and shouldn‚Äôt be avoided.\n\n**Zippers**  \nIf the product has a zipper, look for the letters YKK or Riri stamped on the hardware. If it has no branding, it‚Äôs probably cheap. Zippers are already cheap so if a manufacturer is willing to buy garbage zippers to save a dollar, there‚Äôs a good chance they skimped on the rest of the product as well.\n\n**Hardware (Clips, Buckles, Rings, etc.)**  \nHardware is generally made from three materials. Zinc alloy, steel or brass/stainless steel.  \nZinc alloy is cheap and nasty. If it feels light, plasticky and is not magnetic it‚Äôll be zinc alloy. The surface plating will chip and the metal will wear through or crack. Avoid.  \nSteel is strong, but has to be plated to prevent rust. That‚Äôs fine until the plating wears through or chips.  \nBrass and stainless steel are the top stuff. They‚Äôre strong, wear resistant and rust proof. Brass can tarnish and turn green, but it can be cleaned and polished. Stainless is uncommon, but worth it compared to nickel plated brass or steel.\n\n**Lining Fabrics**  \nThe first point of failure in a bag or wallet is either a zipper or fabric lining. Many products use a thin polyester fabric which eventually frays at the stitching and is a pain to replace. If you‚Äôre buying a wallet you‚Äôll find a lot that are made from the thinnest possible layer of leather with a polyester fabric lining. The thin leather will wear out on the corners and the lining will rip out of the pockets.  \nLining fabric can be done well, but not cheaply.\n\nHopefully that‚Äôs helpful. If you‚Äôre looking for leather goods, please buy locally. There aren‚Äôt many leatherworkers left here in Australia so whether you buy from me or someone else, your support for our small industry is appreciated.\n\nCheers,  \nAndrew Reeson Leather",

        "text": "Dear All,\n\nI‚Äôm not asking for funding here, I hope to gather support for this vision. Community involvement is crucial; I encourage anyone interested to consider volunteering or sharing this idea with others who might want to contribute.\n\nI‚Äôm reaching out to share something very personal. I lost my dad to dementia, a journey that profoundly changed our family. One of my fondest memories is of our afternoons spent at the park, where he would light up at the sight of birds and enjoy a simple picnic with me. Living in Queensland, I‚Äôve been inspired by those moments, and I want to create more like them for families like ours.\n\nI envision a safe, welcoming space where families can enjoy quality time with their loved ones living with dementia. Imagine a beautiful area where they can stroll freely, sit together for a picnic, watch fish swim in a serene pond, enjoy a warm cup of coffee, and listen to the cheerful songs of birds‚Äîall within a secure environment.\n\nThis space would be enclosed, providing peace of mind for caregivers. Even if someone looks away for a moment or feels the urge to wander, they would remain safe, with fencing ensuring they can't leave without their carer. Staff members would be present, ready to lend a helping hand and offer support whenever needed.\n\nTo enhance this experience, we could include memory gardens filled with fragrant plants, art and music therapy sessions, and quiet zones for relaxation. Group activities, like gentle exercise classes and games, could foster social interaction and connection.\n\nI‚Äôd like to name this initiative \"DAN\"‚Äîthe Dementia Activity Network. This name reflects the spirit of connection and community I want to foster. I dream of a place where caregivers can say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to DAN,‚Äù creating a sense of belonging and comfort for everyone involved.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Together, we can create a meaningful space for our loved ones and their caregivers, where moments of joy can flourish amidst the challenges of dementia.\n\nWarm regards,  \nNarghile\n\n",

        "text": "Hey so basically\nI have a parent who was admitted to hospital after a TIA (minor stroke) and we got transferred around to other hospital for incase they needed neuro surgery department But thankfully they did not but i spent the first night holding their phone up in front of them and put on things for them to watch to try keeping their stress down (because they have sort of a minor phobia/fear of being in hospital because of personal experiences) until it ran out of power. Then looked into tv access for them (which you have to pay for) For when visitor access wasnt allowed. But assumed it was like a entertainment package given the price but its not its just free to air channels. and now that they are no longer a high risk they were transferred back to the local hospital again but they will have to stay there a while for recovery with physical therapy as their left side doesnt respond to commands\n\nBut they are a bit older, and not good with tech at all and now limted motor functions so i rented more tv time to help with the angst.\n\nIs there something i can do or buy. (like a urc remote or something to plug into it)\nBecause i dont think we should have to pay for non refundable free to air tv that is charged per day not amount used when they might only watch an hour or two of it when their alert and aware\n\nI mention their state above before anyone suggests.\nDevices,tablets,laptops,phone. They dont recommend leave expensive devices around incase someone tries to steal them. And with them falling in and out of consciousness they have already dropped their phone once or it slid off the bed. the tv is the best solution option because they dont have capacity and awareness to use other devices. \n\nFor reference the tv rental provider is hillstv\n\nI dont mind if i get in trouble for trying or asking but it seems so wrong to do that to people with fragile mental states, bed bound or going through the most stressful moments of their lives and could use a distraction. \n\nIm sure someone will say why shouldnt you have to pay. \nSure if it was resonable fee for like renting the tv itself like $1 a day that covers maintenance/repairs or various options for premium channels packages that would be fine. \n\nBut they are just free to air channels that some wards can in fact watch for free.\n\n\nFor example i believe tv was free in the neurology ward but not icu trauma and only up to what i can only assume is whatever the bed allocation was at the time they got the service installed. Like in neurology beds 1-49 was free tv access. but beds 50-69 were pay to use tvs. when i contacted the helpline they said those beds weren't listed so they are supposed to be to free access and i had to explain the only 3 channels it has are there how to rent slideshows. Its not like the department extended the ward added all the signs and new labels and directional information overnight. These clearly should have been inspected and updated by their service technicians when those beds were assigned there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1/11/24 \nDid some research the other day on the tvs themselves.unit is a hotel tv a (lg lt360c) they set them up with a master TV unit then just clone the settings onto all their tvs and plug sort of like a set top box into them that has a (lock mode) that prevents the physical buttons on the side and blocks other signal inputs like to the hdmi port. \n\nWent to plug in firestick and a ward nurse asked me to unplug it. And \"it's against hospital policy to allow people to plug devices into their TVs because they are untested with their system and don't know if they would make their tvs explode\" \n\nOne also said something about people could upload virus's but that's not how that works. You mean could literally unplug everything apart from the power plug but I'm guessing they wouldn't allow that either. \n\nFigured nurses would be interested in looking after patients not TV's but guess that's not the case for all of them. Most I've talked to think it's unfair and that it should be free but I dunno. \n\nMaybe this info will help someone else in future.\n\nTv Unit \nLg lt360c (hotel tv)\nAt least at the two hospitals I've been at. Not sure if they use the same everywhere\nPlugs on back \nAntenna\nVga and aux plug go to the bedside remote control.\nThe set top box module. Has lan,a/c and j/b plug\n",
